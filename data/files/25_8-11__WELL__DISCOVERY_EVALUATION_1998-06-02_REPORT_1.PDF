INTRODUCTION Well 25/8-11 was drilled to test the Ringhorn prospect. The well discovered a thin oil zone in the Early Eocene - Late Paleocene Hermod Formation and a thicker oil zone in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. Well location and PL027 acreage status are shown in Figure 1.1. One core was cut in the Paleocene. The well drilled to TD at depth of 1994 mdrkb in the Jurassic. After wireline logging, the 25/8-11 well was drill stem tested in the interval from 1892.5 to mdrkb (1874.5 - mtvdss). The well flowed at stabilized rate of approximately 3250 STB/D of oil. The well was temporarily plugged and suspended as an oil discovery. Figure shows the stratigraphy in the well.

SUMMARY Well 25/8-11 was spudded on October 16, 1997 and reached F.T.D on October 31st, 1997. The well was drilled to core point and one core, 0 mmdrkb, was cut. The top of the target Paleocene Zone 11 sand was found at  mmdrkb (-1746.9 mtvdss). Top of massive Zone II sand was penetrated at The well drilled into the Jurassic at 1891 mmdrkb (-1873 mtvdss) and oil bearing sands were found. The TD of the well is at 1994 mrkb (-1976 mtvdss) in L. Jurassic aged sediments. The well was evaluated with wireline logs and drill stem tested in the Jurassic. The interval from 1892.5-1909.5 mmdrkb (1874.5-1891.5 mtvdss) was perforated and flowed at an average stabilized rate of 3250 STB/D on 40/64 choke. The total flow period was 24 hours with buildup period of 50 hours. The density of the oil was 39 API at standard conditions. Well 25/8-11 was temporarily plugged and suspended December 2, 1997. 2.2 Reserves summary of the 25/8-11, Ringhorn Discovery In the Tertiary Zone II sand the oil in place is calculated to be in the range of 3.0 106 Sm3 to 106 Sm3 (20 - 27 MBO) and the recoverable reserves in the range of 106 Sm3 to 106 Sm3 (5 - MBO EUR). Average recovery is in the 25% - 35% range. In the Jurassic, the oil in place is calculated to be in the range from 15 to 26.4 106 Sm3 (94 - 166 MBO). The recoverable reserves are assessed to be in the range from to 106 Sm3 (20 - 58 MBO). The average recovery factors range from 15% - 50%. Trap size and difficulties in mapping the top reservoir and predicting net to gross, were the main uncertainties in the Jurassic assessment. 2.3 Field Development The Ringhorn most likely recoverable reserves in the Jurassic are estimated at 40 MBO. The conceptual development plan includes five wells; three multi-lateral producers and two dual injectors using splitter wellhead technology. One of the producers includes the suspended 25/8-11 discovery well. Several tie-back alternatives are presently being evaluated including utilization of either Balder or Jotun facilities. That study is still underway, thus no final conclusions have been made. H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.D0a25/05/98 page3. DATABASE 3.1 Geological Control The primary well data base used to evaluate PL027 in Block 25/8 is as follow:  Key wells:  Grane area:  Jotun area:  PL169 area: 25/11-21S 8S, 8A and 8B 25/11-16 Log data, well completion reports, unpublished reports and published literature have been used in the evaluation. 3.2 Geophysical Control Mapping of the Ringhorn Prospect is based on interpretation of the ES9403 3D seismic data set acquired in 1994 covering an area of 320 km2 north of the 25/8-1 well. Interpretation based on the NH9301 survey covering the Grane Field area was used for regional integration. Processed migrated, near offset and far offset cubes were utilized from the ES9403 survey. In addition coherency cube was created and utilized in the post-well Jurassic analysis. Checkshot control was available in all 25/8-1, 3, and lOST2 wells and VSPs in the 25/8-4 and 25/8-10ST2 wells. H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.DOC\02/06/98 page4. REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK Block 25/8 is situated in the South Viking Graben on the western side of the Utsira High. The Utsira High is large basement high flanked by the Viking Graben to the west and the Stord Basin to the east. The present relief was formed following Late Jurassic rifting and associated postrift subsidence. The complex fault patterns of the North Sea, with its horsts and grabens of varying shapes and sizes, were formed by extensional tectonism in the Early Permian, possibly following fault trends in the Caledonian basement. Rotliedgendes sands and intraformational conglomerates were deposited as alluvial fans along the margins of the Utsira High, with sediments being sourced from the high itself. During the Triassic period, continental sediments were deposited, and movements on the bounding faults continued. Figure is paleographic map of the Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The formation exhibits transition from continental to shallow marine sediments and is found in several wells on the Utsira High (25/8-2, 25/8-11, 25/8-1,25/10-1). On the downthrown terrace to the west, the Statfjord formation is missing in the wells (25/7-1, 25/10-2, 25/10-8). This indicates that the western flank of the Utsira High was high during deposition of the Statfjord fm and was later faulted down along the bounding faults shown in Fig. 4.1. The present relief of the Utsira High was caused by Jurassic rifting (Kimmerian tectonic phases). The largest rift pulse occurred in the Middle Jurassic (Mid Kimmerian phase) and the associated uplift and erosion of the rift flanks led to the deposition of the non-marine to marginal marine sandstones and shales of the Vestland Group along the western side of the Utsira High. In the Late Jurassic, establishment of the rift system combined with eustatic sea level rise, led to widespread transgression and deep water sedimentation. The western part of the South Viking Graben experienced rapid and extensive syntectonic sedimentation with sands sourced from the Shetland Platform to the west. The Late Kimmerian Phase, occurring the latest Early Cretaceous, reactivated existing faults and created further fault block relief. The Late Cretaceous was period of low tectonic activity. Cooling of the lithosphere, coupled with sediment loading, led to subsidence, and although global sea level was falling, widespread transgression took place in the North Sea. The low elastic input, and high organic production resulted in thick continuous carbonate sequences, which thin toward and over the Utsira High. The dominant geological event in the Tertiary period is the deposition of Paleocene and Lower Eocene deep marine sandstones. The provenance of these sands was the uplifted Shetland Platform to the west. The sediments H:nstorks \ word \25811de_new.DOC \ 02/06/98 page 10were supplied to the basin by eastward prograding deltaic complexes and transported into the basin by high density tubidity processes during lowstand. Overall the Early Eocene and Late Paleocene depositional system is interpreted to consist of compensational of depositional cycles as observed at the Jotun and Balder Fields. (Figure 4.2). The Paleocene sands in the area are found in the Zones IAI and IA2 (Palynozones ET2-6), Zone IB (Palynozones ET6-7), Lower Zone II (Palynozone ET8) and Upper Zone II (Palynozone ET9A). At Ringhorn, Zones IA and IB were shale, with no sand intervals present. The Lower Zone II Sands (Palynozone ET8) are observed in the Balder field where deposition was restricted between the IB mounds paleotopography. Mound in Balder field is interpreted to be Lower zone II sand penetrated by the 25/11-9S and the development wells 25/11 D-1H and the 25/11 D-2H wells. of Lower Zone II sand was penetrated in well 25/8-11. The Upper Zone II Sands (Palynozone ET9A) are observed in the Forseti area (25/8-1, 25/8-3 and 25/8-10 ST2 wells) and are oil bearing (9 m, and respectively). These sands are part of thick, turbidite channelized system coming from the west. They are Lowermost Eocene in age. Thin sands of this age are also found in the development wells in the Balder Mound area. Only of this sand is present in well 25/8-11.

SEISMIC INTERPRETATION 5.1 Seismic Data Quality The Ringhorn prospect was primarily interpreted on the zero phase, full-fold seismic cube on the ES9403 3D seismic survey. The NH9301 3D seismic survey was used to extend the interpretation to the south and east. The seismic data quality is generally fair over the interpreted area which covers 115 km2. The Paleocene section has in general better resolution than the pre-Cretaceous section. Near- and far-offset processed data cubes were also utilized in order to calibrate the seismic to nearby well ties, and to evaluate potential AVO- effects. However, gather analysis have suggested velocity stacking problems over the Forseti area (segment A) and possibly also at Ringhorn. Detailed interpretation and AVO analysis are therefore at present incomplete and unreliable. Reprocessing of the southern part of the 3D survey has been initiated to enhance data quality of the different cubes. A coherency cube was generated post-drill to guide in fault mapping of the 5.2 Seismic ties and Vertical Seismic Profiles (VSP) Synthetic seismogram A synthetic seismogram for well 25/8-11 was constructed in SEISMOD from blocked sonic and density data in order to get one-D model and seismic tie to the well. The synthetic seismogram from 30 hz synthetic over the Paleocene and Jurassic section is shown in fig. 5.1a. The zero-phase negative pulse applied gives negative reflection coefficient corresponding to peak on the synthetic trace. Also shown is the time-depth relationship and the drift curve derived from the VSP checkshots which indicate good linear relationship in the investigated interval. In the 'seismic' column the synthetic trace is plotted at the well location on seismic line (full fold cube) across the well. The synthetic trace tie to the seismic data suggest time shift of msec down relative to the seismic. This shift was determined through cross-correlation of the synthetic and seismic tie at the well location and gave high correlation coefficient of 0.912 for the interval between and seconds. Top Balder and top Chalk ties well when applying the shift. Some differences between the synthetic and the seismic data at the well location are observed at base Balder and in the Jurassic section. Formation tops from Tab. are posted next to the synthetic trace. These tops are checkshot calibrated post-drill time and depth pairs (TWT shifted to fit the seismic).

The survey was recorded from 350 to 1990 mRKB. The receiver array consisted of main tool and two satellites (a third was disconnected after technical problems during acquisition), each containing three component geophone cartridge. The seismic source employed was x 150 cu in sleeve gun for both zero offset and fixed offset. The zero-offset gun was hung at depth of m. and had an operating pressure of 2000 psi. The near field monitor hydrophone was kept at an offset of 62 on the rig and on the vessel. The fixed offset source was located 1452 NW of the rig. Further details concerning acquisition and processing of the VSP data can be found in Zero Offset VSP, Esso Norge AS, 25/08-11 and Fixed Offset VSP, Esso Norge AS, 25/08-11 by Read Well Services. The synthetic ties to the VSP corridor stacks 35 Hz and 50 Hz bandwith are shown in fig 5.1b. and 5.1c. Cross correlation between the VSP and synthetic trace yields similar correlation coefficient to the correlation between the full fold seismic data and the synthetic trace. For the 35 Hz VSP correlation coefficient of is achieved, and is the measured correlation coefficient between the synthetic and the 50 hz VSP, both with an upward shift of msec relative to seismic. Fig 5.3a shows the VSP 35 Hz and 50 Hz spliced into the seismic inline across the well (see fig.5.2 for location of the line) The VSPs are unshifted H:nstorks \word \25811de_new.DOCU5/05/98 page 13relative to seismic. In fig. 5.3.b the VSPs are shifted down msec to show the best tie to the full-fold data. In general the VSP ties well with the seismic, but again the base Balder reflection shows poor tie. 5.3 Interpreted horizons The primary reservoir objective of the well were the deepwater submarine sandstones of the Zone II (Hermod Formation). The following horizons were interpreted prior to drilling: Top Balder FM Base Balder FM Near Base Zone II Top Chalk Top Balder is carried in continuous peak on the full-fold seismic data (upper red reflector fig. 5.4). The post-drill result shows that the well tie is in the trough above. Investigations of wells in the Balder area suggest that the regionally mapped acoustic top Balder does not correspond to the stratigraphic top Balder and that the difference is variable and unpredictable. The acoustic top Balder is strong, continuous event that is easy to correlate on seismic in the area. Base Balder is characterized by decrease in impedance from the overlying Balder shales above to the Paleocene shales below. It ties to black peak in nearby wells and is mapped with generally high confidence in the area. It is an important reflector, as the top Zone 11 reservoir horizon is derived from isopaching down from the base Balder. This is result of the lack of impedance contrast at the top Zone 11 interface. At the 25/8-11 well location doublet is observed on the seismic at base Balder level and as fig. 5.1.a shows, the actual well tie lies in between the two peaks. Pre-drill the base Balder was picked in the shallower peak, and the post-drill seismic tie could indicate that base Balder should be picked closer to the lower peak. This could explain some of the difference in prognosed versus actual base Balder. The VSP data, however, indicates that top Balder should be picked in the shallower peak. Due to lack of seismic character, the top Zone II sand map is extracted from the base Balder interpretation by adding constant shale isopach. Near base Zone II is strong, relatively continuous reflection that corresponds to black peak on the seismic and is tied close to base sand in the control wells (yellow reflector in fig 5.4). Top Chalk is carried in well defined strong trough (dark blue reflector Fig. 5.4) The time interpretation on the full-fold seismic cube of the ES9403 survey has very high confidence. Top Chalk interpretation shows, however, up to 10 msec shift between the full fold and far offset cubes, and the shift between the seismic and the VSP data is 6-8 msec. This indicates potential H:nstorks \ word \25811de_new.D0002/06/98 page 14errors with the velocities in the seismic data. Ongoing reprossesing of ES9403 will investigate these problems. Base Cretaceous over Ringhom was interpreted on coarse grid prior to drilling the well (D.Poole 1995), but the interpretation was not included in the pre-drill evaluation as the Jurassic prospectivity was considered at that time as high risk. new base Cretaceous interpretation was completed including the new well following the Jurassic discovery. This interpretation is the basis for the post-well Jurassic evaluation. The base Cretaceous is difficult to tie in well 25/8-11 due to the strong response of the 15 thick Chalk section above. Base Cretaceous is picked in peak, but the actual tie is msec shallower. preliminary Top Permian interpretation was done to guide the Jurassic interpretation. Top Zone II and base Cretaceous depth maps representing the top of the two oil zones are presented in figs. and 5.6. 5.4 Depth Conversion Base Balder and top Chalk horizons were depth converted pre-drill using seismic stacking velocities from the ES9403 3D survey. Time to depth analysis was performed with Earthmodel (0. Burtz, July 1997). Velocity slice method with correction for anisotropy and ray bending effect was used. After applying bulk shift of computed using wells 25/8-1,3,4 and 1 OST2, the average absolute error was only m. As part of the t/d evaluation, crossplotting of the actual depths versus seismic times at well locations was performed, resulting in 20 deeper prognosis at Ringhom. The ES9403 seismic survey was also merged with NH9301 and the Balder surveys and the resulting depth values were closer to the actual depths in the well. However, it was decided to keep the depth conversion based on the ES9403 only, and the wells to the south-east for calibration. Due to lack of impedance contrast, there is no top reservoir time interpretation for the Paleocene sand. Top Zone II sand depth map was therefore produced pre-drill by adding 25 of Paleocene shale (average thickness in nearby wells) to the Base Balder depth map. Near Base Zone 11 was depth converted pre-drill using velocity function based on wells 25/8-3, 25/8-1 and 25/8-4 as follows: Base Balder to near base Zone 111 isopach = isochron 1220 m/s + 2103 m. The isopach was added to the Base Balder depth map and the resulting map was then flexed to the wells. Both base Balder and top Chalk horizons were found about 30 deeper in the well than prognosed. An amplitude anomaly observed in the shallower  section (seen at approximately seconds in the seismic line in fig. 6.1.) turned out to be high velocity limestone beds that could account for approximately 10 pull-up. The rest of the difference is probably due to problems with the stacking velocities used in the depth conversion method H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.DOCU5/05/98 page 15chosen which was based on the ES9403 survey. Only wells located close to the edge of the survey were used for calibration. Edge effects in the seismic velocities has probably influenced the depth conversion, and using merged seismic surveys and including all the Balder Field wells would have given better prediction. In the post-drill evaluation new base Balder depth map was used. This map was created by depth-converting merged base-Balder interpretation covering the Ringhom, Forseti, Balder and Grane area (Seismic surveys ES9403, B88, NH9301 and CN257) and flexing to the new well. new top Zone11 map was created by adding constant thick Paleocene shale to the new base Balder map. Base Cretaceous/Top Jurassic reservoir map was created post-drill by using constant average velocity from the well down to the top Cretaceous and adding 15 of Chalk to the resulting map. This method is considered appropriate over the fault block in which the well was drilled, but outside the fault block the Chalk thickness varies in thickness from in well 25/8-2, west of Ringhom, to 70 in well 25/8-1 to the east. As the Chalk has high interval velocity, this stratigraphic thinning of the unit would result in the map potentially being pulled up west of the Ringhom structure and pushed down east of the structure.

Top of massive sand (lower Zone II) is at 1755.5 mss and the upper Zone II above is in thickness. The prognosed OWC was at 1760 mss based on the average contact in the Balder Field. The well confirmed that the OWC in PL027 is shallower than 1760 mss, as shown in Table 6.3. Jurassic The Jurassic trap is horst structure bounded by faults along the east and west side, and the OWC is at mss (Fig. 5.6). As described in Chapter 5.4 simple depth conversion was used to derive the current base Cretaceous map and the varying Chalk thickness should be taken into account in final depth conversion following the reprocessing of ES9403. Table Tertiary Oil-Water Contacts ODT -1742 OWC -1 WUT -1758 H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.D0002/06/98 page 196.3 Reservoir description Tertiary section The reservoir above the OWC in the Tertiary consists of Early Eocene Upper Zone II (ET9A?) and Paleocene Lower Zone II (ET8?). One core was cut through both sands. The cored interval is shown in fig. and the core description is shown in fig. 6.4. The reservoir quality of the sands are very good to excellent consistent with the Balder Field and in the Forseti wells. Log analysis show N/ values of 0.85-0.96 and porosity values of 33- 35%. Jurassic section The Jurassic Statfjord Fm reservoir consists of an upper section with interbedded thin sands and shales. (Equivalent to the Fensf)ord fm in the Brage Field). This zone was tested and flowed 3250 STB/D of oil. The section below the thin sands is divided into two zones called 'Upper sand' and 'Lower sand', each containing more massive sands. In the wells in the area that have penetrated the Statfjord Fm, the N/G values span from to 0.96 and the porosity values varies from 17.5% - 28.2%. Log analysis of well 25/8-11 give values of 0.24-0.92 for N/G and 24-32% for porosity. 6.4 Sedimentological development The geological model for the Tertiary reservoir intervals is based on the deposition of series of submarine fans transported from the East Shetland Platform, which is considered to be the provenance area, onto the flanks of the Utsira High (Figure 4.2). The core from well 25/8-11 confirms the geological model. It captures the upper Zone II sand and most of the lower Zone 11 sand. The gain size of the sands varies from fine to medium and are moderate to poorly sorted. It is homogenous and generally structureless. This indicates rapid deposition of sheet sands from high density debris flow. The Jurassic section in well 25/8-11 was not cored. The Statfjord Fm is deposited in transitional environment consisting of lower alluvial plain and braided stream deposits, and usually exhibits massive sandstones interbedded with silts and shales. 6.5 Source, Maturation and Migration The primary source for charging the prospect is the organic rich shales of the Upper Jurassic Draupne Formation (Kimmeridgian). The source is not present at Ringhorn and generally thin and immature in the north-east Balder area as shown in well 25/8-1, but thickens down into the Viking Graben where it is in the oil window. Maturation studies indicate that hydrocarbon expulsion and migration started in the Late Cretaceous and has continued to present day. Based on the presence of shows and discoveries hydrocarbons have been moving through large parts of the system from the Viking Graben to the Utsira High. Migration is thought to have occurred west and north-west of H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.D0002/06/98 page 20the Balder Field in Blocks 25/7 and 10 along the major Utsira High bounding faults. There may also be areas where major faults juxtapose upper Jurassic Draupne formation and the lower Jurassic Statfjord formation directly. In the same area where the Cretaceous section is absent, vertical migration into Paleocene sands can occur. From there the migration route is likely to lead into the Balder Field, the Ringhorn Field, the Forseti Field and finally the Grane Field as reflected by progressively changing oil properties (Tab 6.4). The presence of oil in wells 25/8-11,10, 1, and demonstrate the efficiency of the Tertiary hydrocarbon system from west to east. Although the closest wells to Ringhorn have no or poor shows in the pre- Cretaceous section, well 25/10-4 displayed good live oil shows from the Permian through the Jurassic section which proves that migration has taken place in the deeper section, along the flank of the Utsira High. Table Tertiary Crude Parameters BALDER FORSETI GRANE API 24 21.4-21.9 19 VISCOSITY CP 1/Bo 6.6 Seal The Lower Eocene sands are sealed by overlying Early Eocene shales as demonstrated by the presence of oil in the wells 25/8-1, 3, 10, 11 and 4. Top seal for the Jurassic reservoir is the Cretaceous Chalk section which is locally thick in the east and thins westwards towards the major fault zone. 15 Chalk is present in well 25/8-11 versus 70 in well 25/8-1 km to the south-east. The overlying shales of the Ty formation may also contribute to the seal.

The mud is relatively heavy with weight of g/cc. The bit size was 8.5 in. The hole seems to be in good shape, no significant wash-outs, with caliper reading an average in. above bit size. The average deviation is small enough to consider the hole vertical for the purpose of this analysis (tvdss = mdrkb - 18m). The wireline logs used in this interpretation were acquired by Schlumberger, 01-03 November 1997, in several runs combining the following services:  AIT / UBI / DSI Array Induction Tool Ultrasonic Borehole Imager Dipole Sonic Imaging Tool  CMR / IPL Combinable Magnetic Resonance Tool Integrated Porosity and Lithology Tool, including: LDS Litho Density Sonde HNGS Natural Gamma Ray Spectrometry Sonde (Hostile Environment)  LDL / CNL All relevant logs were environmentally corrected and input in Schlumberger's forward modelling framework, ELAN', for this evaluation. The CMR run prompted while-logging decisions that were instrumental in discovering and assessing productive micaceous sands in the Jurassic section of the well. substantial amount of net pay might have been overlooked otherwise. Good producibility was confirmed by the production test conducted over the Jurassic Thin Sands (see 7.4). Based on an estimated net pay thickness of 15 m, an average permeability of 350 mD was derived from the pressure transient analysis. This value compares well with the non core- calibrated permeability profile derived from the CMR bound fluid measurement. The purpose of this analysis is to compute net thicknesses and average porosities / saturations for the Hermod Zone II (Tertiary) and Statfjord (Jurassic) sands. Details of the log analysis are documented in Geological Completion Report, well 25/8-11 section Log Analysis. The main results are summarized in the tables hereafter. 1 part of GeoQuesr GeoFrame package; H:nstorks \ word \25811de_new.DOC\02/06/98 page 22Table results of the log analysis for the Hermod Sands. -4,- og is Summary: Ringhorn 2518-11 Hermod Sands gross zone top base interval ,. mdrkb net sand ratio net sand/ gross thickness porosity Sw HPV md/tvd pu su all summations performed using 0508m increment VcI < 20 % and > 25 pu Table results for the Statfjord Sands; KCMR cutoff set at 80 mD.

Assuming constant geothermal gradient gives reservoir temperature at the Tertiary OWC (1,775m mdrkb) of C, close to the regional Balder OWC temperature. A best fit through the water data points of Pickett plot over the Tertiary sands and shales yields = for the cementation exponent and aRw = .0657, corresponding2 to 47 ppk salinity, also consistent with the Balder area. Laboratory measurement of the Jurassic water sample acquired with the MDT at 1,938 mdrkb, gives Rw=0.1205 cm @ 20 C. This is equivalent to an NaC1 salinity of ppk 3, which yields Rw = Om @ C (OWC at 1935.5m). The same NaCl-equivalent salinity corresponds to theoretical density of g/cc at lab conditions (15 C, atmospheric pressure), to be compared with the measured value: g/cc. Converting 1.048 g/cc at in-situ conditions (85 C, 191 bar) gives: g/cc. This density is consistent with the pressure gradient derived from the upper four pressure points measured by the MDT in the water leg of the Jurassic sands. Force fitting (Y on X) through aRw = yields m= 2.01. on Pickett plot over the Statfjord, Lower Sands interval. In the absence of RI measurements, for both the Tertiary and the Jurassic pay zones, the cementation exponent was kept at nominal value of 2. The mineralogical model is based on patterns and trends observed on individual and cross-plotted log responses, and on regional knowledge. Besides quartz and clay, it includes mineral representing mixture of feldspars and micas, which is mainly differentiated from clays by the natural gamma ray spectrometry measurements (Thorium and Potassium concentration logs). ELAN computes porosities taking the mineralogy and fluid effects into account automatically. The presence of mud filtrate (and possibly of light hc) and the effects of clay (and other) minerals are accounted for by the response equations simultaneously solved by the ELAN optimizer, ensuring accurate porosity and saturation calculations, provided the model and its end-points are also accurate. As ELAN is forward model-based optimizing program, all logs intervene to some extent in the derivation of the amount of clay as part of the global solution. In this case where natural gamma ray spectroscopy log is 2 using the estimated reservoir temperature, C. 3 the lab-measured total dissolved solids expressed in the same units (i.e. dividing the concentration (68,580 mg/I) by the sample density measured at 15 C (1.048 g/cc)) is slightly higher: ppk. This is probably due to the other than - and not as conductive as - NaCI ions present in the solution (see details of full chemical analysis). H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.D0002/06/98 page 24available, the Thorium and Potassium concentrations are important players in the optimization process. The saturations were computed using the Dual Water saturation equation. CMR processing The echo-trains were re-processed using the GeoFrame software in town. There are three important aspects to the CMR logging and reprocessing: 1. the tool is not CMR-200 tool: it is not supposed to be able to measure the clay-bound water, hence the so-called total CMR porosity is the effective porosity; 2. the log was acquired as fast, bound-fluid pass; the fast logging speed is permitted by using relatively short wait time with the aim of polarizing at least the entire bound fluid volume (BFV), but not necessarily all of the effective porosity; moreover, in water-wet reservoir, the fast-relaxing fluid (T2's less than 33 msec) is assumed to be the capillary-bound, irreducible water; the oil (moveable and residual) relaxes at bulk rate; 3. the raw echo-trains were reprocessed with the latest software, which allows to look for T2's as short as msec (as opposed to msec) and the good level of the S/N ratio permitted to start with the first echo; Figures and are composite displays of the ELAN results along with the log inputs over the Tertiary and Jurassic sections respectively (m mdrkb). The main formation tops (mdrkb and tvdss) and net sand intervals are also indicated. The general format is described hereafter. Specific comments to each section follow. The page to the left shows the conventional logs. From left to right: - track 1: caliper, bit size, total gamma ray and uranium-free gamma ray (thorium and potassium contributions only) from HNGS; - track 2: Rt and Rxo from AIT (deepest and shallowest readings); - track 3: thermal neutron from CNT and bulk density from IPL, both acquired in high resolution mode and alpha-processed; limestone- compatible scales; - track 4: Thorium and Potassium concentrations from HNGS; scales designed to emphasize low Th / ratio intervals where quartz/micas/feldpars are predominant according to the mineralogical model; the yellow shading is only qualitative indication: it must not be interpreted like the positive x-over between neutron / density logswhen plotted with limestone-compatible scales; The page to the right shows the CMR and MDT data and the ELAN results. From left to right: - track 5: CMR reprocessed T2 distributions; - track 6: CMR total porosity split in bound and free fluid volumes based on T2 = 33 msec cutoff; - track 7: MDT pressures; uncalibrated, CMR-derived permeability using Timur-Coates formula (see further down); - track 8: ELAN volumetric analysis; - track 9: Net Sand; - track 10: porosity analysis: total porosity, effective porosity; - track 11: effective water saturation; H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.D0002/06/98 page 25In tracks and 10, the light blue shaded area is the amount of irreducible water output by ELAN based of the amount of bound fluid seen by the CMR, i.e. strongly constrained by the CMR BFV input; in track 10 the BFV input (red curve) is displayed, showing how well the constraint was respected. Tertiary section: Sele / Lista shales, Hermod Zone II sands. The Sele shales exhibit their characteristic high uranium content (track 1). The CMR raw echo trains (track 5) make the reservoir sands clearly stand out with long T2 distributions (slow relaxation), whereas the fast-relaxing shales exhibit packed, short T2's. Accordingly track shows no free fluid in shales and hardly any bound fluid in the Hermod reservoir sands. According to the Dual Water shaley sand model, shale is mixture of clay and quartz. Most of the time VCL < 100% and consequently shales will exhibit porosity, filled with non-clay-bound water. However both the resistivity and the CMR logs agree to fill completely the effective porosity in the shales with irreducible, capillary-bound water: there is good match between phi*Sw from Rt and BFV from CMR (tracks and 10). The CMR porosity deficit in the reservoir sands is due to the fast logging conditions. Wait time too short to polarize all the free fluids. The determination of net sand intervals in the Hermod fm is rather straightforward. On the basis of OEFF vs VCL cross-plot the following cutoffs were chosen: - VCL < 20 % and - OEFF > 25 pu No additional Sw cutoff was used to determine net pay: net sands above OWC are deemed net pay. The OWC was set at 1,775 mdrkb (1,757 tvdss) above residual oil pocket. Net sand intervals are coded green in Figure 7.1. Jurassic section: Statfjord sands and shales. While-drilling initial interest was sparked by the LWD resistivity increase and GR drop in relatively thin interval (1,911.8 1,914.5 mdrkb), compared to shale-like base line above and below, apart from couple of thin beds apparently indicative of the proximity of contact. A superficial look at the conventional wireline logs confirmed the general pattern and the small net pay interval. The CMR run threw different light, making clear distinction between the intervals above and below 1,942.4 mdrkb. For example quick look at the amount of free fluid in the shales between 1,891.0 and 1,911.8 mdrkb, was enough to prompt the acquisition of additional MDT pressure tests and radical change in the perspective of the petrophysical model, revealing much longer interval of net pay, in - probably highly laminated - micaceous sands. As in the Tertiary section, the amount of capillary-bound water is constrained by the input of BFV from the CMR. It is well matched by the amount of water seen by the resistivity in the pay and in the shales. H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.D0002/06/98 page 26The net sand determination in the Jurassic section is less straightforward. On the basis of OEFF vs VCL cross-plot the following cutoffs were chosen: - VCL < 42 % and - OEFF >18 pu. A permeability profile was derived from the CMR using the Timur- Coates formula: KCMR,TC = ivY'EFFlA  10 EFF ) V' BF BF where: - normally OEFF would be the total NMR porosity, but in this case the effective porosity output by ELAN (driven by the bulk density) was used because of the fast-pass logging conditions affecting the free fluid porosity measurement; - OBF is the NMR-measured bound fluid porosity (BFV). An attempt was made to use this profile as third discriminator to determine net sand - and net pay above the OWC contact - in the Statfjord fm. Table and Figure show the results when the KCMR cutoff is set at 80 mD. The resulting net sand intervals are coded green. The extra-amount of net sand obtained when the KCMR discriminator is not applied, is coded yellow. 7.1.3 Routine Core analysis Routine core analysis is planned for the Paleocene section and will include plug porosities and permeabilities. The NPD will be provided with the final report from the laboratory when completed. 7.2 MDT pressures and samples, pressure gradient Pressure measurements and fluid samples were collected at different levels in Tertiary and Jurassic. Paleocene/Eocene Pressure measurements were taken in the Paleocene and Eocene oil leg (Upper and Lower ZII sandstones) and in the Paleocene water bearing sections. The FWL were calculated to be at 1757.2m TVDSS. Oil and water gradients were calculated to and bar/m, respectively (fig. 7.3a). Some pressure points were excluded from the gradient calculation because of unstable pressure behavior during the measurement. Two 450 cc and gallon oil samples were taken with the MDT tool for analysis in local PVT laboratory. However, mud contamination precluded any PVT work. Jurassic Pressure measurements were taken in the Jurassic oil leg (Upper Statfjord Fm) and in the upper part of the water bearing section. The FWL were calculated to be at 1916m TVDSS. Oil and water gradients were calculated to and bar/m, respectively. One pressure point was excluded from the oil gradient calculation because of unstable pressure behavior H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.DOC\02/06/98 page 27during the measurement. Two 450 cc oil samples, gallon oil and gallon water sample were taken by MDT from the Jurassic. The oil from the 1 gallon oil sample was opened on-site and an API gravity of 43 was measured. The remaining oil samples were sent to local PVT laboratory for analysis, but mud filtrate contamination precluded performing the PVT evaluation Analysis of the water sample gave water density of g/cc at standard conditions with total dissolved solids of 68,580 mg/l. The lower three water pressure measurements indicate higher relative pressure in the lower part of the logged Statfjord Formation, indicating pressure barrier between pressure point 30 and 31 and between 29 and 30 (fig. 7.3b). 7.3 UBI (Ultrasonic Borehole Imager) A UBI tool was run, processed and interpreted over the interval 1682m - 1986m. Logs were processed and interpreted by Schlumberger GeoQuest The UBI image quality was in general of moderate to very poor quality. The zones of poor image quality appear to be caused by waveform noise in the borehole during logging. Mean structural dip was interpreted by GeoQuest with moderate to high confidence as 0/3200 between 1682-1940 m, and 70/2500 in the interval 1940-1986. It was attempted to use image logs to establish sand shale ratio. GeoQuest interpreted the interval 1891-1986 to contain approximately 40-50% sand. However, due to the low quality on images, this interpretation is of low confidence. 7.4 Production Test Introduction This section summarizes the results of the pressure transient test. The original report is presented in ref /1/. Test Objectives In November 1997 drill stem test of the Jurassic Thin Sands at the Ringhorn discovery was performed. The objectives of the production test were, (1) Conduct safe test. (2) Determine well productivity. (3) Obtain representative fluid samples for PVT analysis, initial reservoir pressure and temperature. (5) Estimate reservoir properties. (6) Detect possible no-flow or constant pressure boundaries. Test Results The test consisted of 24 hours flow period, 18 hours at stable sand free rate of 3250 bpd and 50 hours build-up period. H:nstorks\word\25811de_new.DOC\02/06/98 page 28The net Jurassic Thin Sands thickness was estimated at 15 TVD from open hole logs. 17 meter perforation interval from 1893-1910 MD RKB was perforated through inches liner. Figure summarizes the DST with both flow rates and bottom hole pressures shown on the plot. As seen from the plot the stable flow rate is kept for 18 hours while the build-up was 50 hours. Well Productivity The productivity for the perforated interval (1893 to 1910 TVDRKB) was determined using data from the end of the stable 3250 bopd stable flow period. Flow Rate [stbo/d] 3250 Effective Reservoir Pressure @ 1882 TVDSS 2682 Flowing Pressure @ 1882 TVDSS 2504 Productivity Index 18 bpd/psi Table 5.1: Input to productivity calculations The productivity value of 18 bpd/psi is within the range that could be expected for well that has perforation interval of 17 and is flowing through perforated casing. Well Test Analysis An analytical evaluation of the test was performed using the PanSystem Well Test evaluation software. The results of the analysis of the pressure transient test are described below. (1) Permeability was estimated to be 350 mD and the skin factor 1; both from Homer Middle Time Region (MTR) analysis and type curve matching (Homer, Figure 7.5). net pay thickness of 15 was assumed. The distance to the first boundary is estimated to be 120 meters based on Homer analysis. (2) The boundary system is fairly complex based on geologic input. Both the Homer and log-log plot (Figure and 7.6) support this conclusion (Homer late time slope doubling and log-log late time curve slope). (3) The pressure only built up to within 24 psia of original which indicates either incomplete pressure recovery or some degree of pressure depletion; however, we are unable to conclude from the analytical model.

RESOURCE ASSESSMENT 8.1 Definitions of reservoirs Tertiary Top Zone II reservoir map was created using the post-drill depth converted Base Balder map and adding constant Paleocene shale isopach of as found in the well. Paleozene zone II gross rock volume was computed by multiplying the area above the OWC at 1757 mss with sand thickness at Ringhorn. This is considered the average Zone II thickness, including both upper and lower Zone II sand. Jurassic Post-drill top Jurassic reservoir map was created using Base Cretaceous time interpretation and simple depth-conversion using well 25/8-11 velocity down to top Cretaceous. 15 of Chalk was then added to the top Chalk map. As the Chalk thickness is variable, the map will be deeper to the east and shallower to the west of the main block where the well is located. Over the main part of the reservoir, the velocity is considered valid approximation. Therefore, the eastern block bounding fault is used as barrier to the east in the volume calculations (fig. 5.6). The top reservoir map is shown in fig. 5.6. Based on the seismic data, flat layer cake model is considered the best approximation for the distribution of the Jurassic reservoir sands. Top upper sand map is created by combining base Cretaceous and flat grid at 1894 mss and top lower sand map is created combining base Cretaceous and flat grid at 1909 mss. Isopach maps were then generated and GRVs calculated in ZMAP. conceptual cross section showing the distribution of the Jurassic section is shown in fig. 8.1. 8.2 Reservoir Parameters Table shows the primary well database for Paleocene reservoir parameters and Figure summarize the parameters used for calculating hydrocarbon in place.

This thickness was multiplied with the areal extent of the sand above the oil-water contact as seen in fig. 8.2. The different volumetric cases were derived using constant GRV and variable reservoir parameters shown in fig. 8.2. The Statfjord Fm was divided into different zones and gross rock volumes were calculated for each of them. The zones are referred to as the 'thin sands' (21 thick), the 'upper sand' (15 m) and the 'lower sand' (15 m). The zones were then assigned different reservoir parameters for the low, most likely and high cases as shown in Fig. 8.3. 8.4 Stock Tank Oil In Place and Estimated Ultimate Recovery The Ringhorn Tertiary oil in place is estimated to range from to 106 Sm3 (20 - 27 MBO) with recoverable reserves ranging from to 106 Sm3 (5 - MBO). The Jurassic the oil in place is calculated to be in the range from 15 to x 106 Sm3 (94 - 166 MBO) and the recoverable reserves are calculated to range from to 106 Sm3 (20 - 58 MBO).

One dual multi-lateral oil producer (vertical completion in the thin sands and horizontal lateral in the Paleocene). The saved 25/8-11 wellbore will be used for this well.  One commingled multi-lateral oil producer (two branches in the thin oil on water Jurassic interval).  Two dual flankwater injectors with deviated branches targeting the Thin sands and the Upper clean sands. The flank of the Upper clean sand lies outside the flank of the Thin sands which necessitates the directional deviated branches. The Jurassic interval can be divided into three sub-reservoirs for the purpose of development planning; the Thin sands, Upper clean sands and Lower clean sands. Even though the sections are in pressure communication over geologic time, the shale sections present between the Thin and Upper Sands plus coal layers between the Upper and Lower sands will likely create separation during production time. As such, the development plan includes completions that will independently develop each of the three sections. See Figure (CPI Log). Ringhom map showing well locations in Figure 9.1. Paleocene A horizontal branch is planned for the development of the thin Paleocene sand. recovery of MBO is expected using recovery factor of 30% assuming moderate acquifer support. The reduced recovery factor is driven by the thin sand environment and overall sweep efficiency assumptions (-3 m). Thin Sands The Thin sand package (1 md rkb) is thinly laminated section based on log and sidewall core interpretation. Two oil producer and two water injection completions are planned to develop approximately 12 MBO using recovery factor of 40%. One of the oil producer completions will utilize the existing 25/8-11 wellbore which is downdip of an optimal crestal location. The other completion would be located crestally in newly drilled well to allow sweep of the oil from the downdip water injectors to the crest. No aquifer support is expected due to the assumed poor vertical communication of the thin laminated sands. H:nstorks\worch2.5811de_new.DOC U5/05/98 page 33Deviated or vertical wellbores penetrating the full section are preferred due to the laminated nature of the section. horizontal completion would likely not drain the reservoir as effectively. Upper Sands The Jurassic interval from approximately 1912 to 1919 md rkb would be developed by one horizontal branch supported by two downdip water injector completions. The expected recovery is 11 MBO using 45% recovery factor. Flank aquifer support is expected to be weak given the limited regional extent. Lower Sands The Lower sand is clean sand on water from 1927 to 1935 md rkb. Even with favorable mobility ratio, high rates of water coning are expected from the multi-lateral well with two horizontal branches due to the thin oil column. The recovery is estimated to be 16 MBO using 25% recovery factor. The recovery factor is low relative to the other sands intervals due to the thin oil column on water.
