plots referred to below, each processing step is displayed using the SEC normal po- larity convention whereby an upgoing compressional wave, reflected by an increase of acoustic impedance with depth, is displayed as white trough INTRODUCTION The VSP was acquired with three component tool using rig source in vertical well Prior to the processing described here, the raw data, the surface (hydrophone) traces and the downhole (geophone) traces, have been evaluated and bad traces removed before the stacking For acquisition particulars, see the Well Seismic Service Acquisition Report THE PROCESSING Below, the processing of the data through to the final versions is described in terms of the plots presentedSTACK DATA PLO shows the stacked downhole geophone data A median stack was performed on the raw data for all components, of the good shots at each level using the surface sensor break times as the zero time for stacking The good traces of each level are selected depending on their mutual coherency This stacking procedure more efficiently suppresses random noise then the more conventional summation stack The break time of each trace is recomputed after stacking and displayed as TRANSIT TIME, which is now the transit time from surface sensor to the first compressional arrival The transit times are also shown on the plot as tick marks VERTICAL COMPONENT PROCESSING AMPLITUDE RECOVERY PLOT shows the vertical component data from plot after the application of sixth- order zero-phase Butterworth filter with band pass of 4-80 HZ and time varying gain of the exponential form 2, )1 24 GAIN(T) = (273 where is the recorded time down the trace and To is the break time of the trace Whole trace equalisation has been made by normalising the RMS amplitude of the first breaks to correct for geometrical spreading and transmission losses of the direct wave, so the data now simulates plane wavefield static shift of +5ms has been applied to bring the one way times to MSL and are displayed in the column labeled, TRANSIT TIME SDR VELOCITY FILTER DOWNGOING WAVEFIELD SUBTRACTION PLOT shows the data after wavefield separation The downgoing coherent energy is estimated using seven level median tracking filter The filter array is moved one level after each computation and the process is repeated level by level over the entire dataset As result, the deepest and shallowest traces are lost because of edge effects The residual wavefield is obtained by subtracting the downgoing coherent compressional energy (estimated above) from the total wavefield It is important to emphasis that this output has no coherency filter applied At this stage, the assumption is made that the downgoing energy at given level illumi- nates the halfspace below the geophone and is convolved with the earth reflectivity sequencebelow that level In this case the downgoing wavefield consist of direct waves and multi- ple reflections only This assumption facilitates removal of multiples present in the upgoing wavefield, by applying to the upgoing wavefield the deconvolution operator derived from the downgoing wavefield PREDICTIVE DECONVOLUTION PLOT shows the data after predictive deconvolution The deconvolution operator is designed trace by trace using prediction time of 30 ins Further prewhitening of the spectrum by 5% has been applied The design window length is 1000 ms and once the design is made on the downgoing trace, the operator is applied to both the downgoing and upgoing traces at he same level The result of the predictive deconvolution on the data is shown in PLOT The deconvolution is applied before any coherency enhancement in order to collapse the multiple sequence of shear arrivals, diffractions or out of plane reflections The deconvolution operator has performed well, eliminating number of well defined multiples evident from plot WAVESHAPING DECONVOLUTION PLOT shows the data after waveshapmg deconvolution applied Wiener-Levinson zero-phase waveshapmg filter was applied to the data after velocity filtering The desired output is zero phase wavelet with bandwidth of 5-70 Hz The operator is computed for each level of the profile using design window length of 1000 Ens starting 20 ms before the break-times picked in order to include any energy before these break-times 5% white noise has been added to the data Once the design is made on the downgotng trace, the operator is applied to both the downgoing and upgoing traces at the same level The operator is recomputed level by level CORRIDOR STACK A corridor stack is computed on the data after deconvolution defining time window approximately 100 ms wide along the time depth curve and stacking the data onto single trace This trace should satisfy the assumption of one dimensionality and provide the best seismic representation of the borehole The PLOT and displays this trace as well as the corresponding enhanced deconvolved upgomg wavefields MIGRATION The final wavefield after predictive deconvolution were migrated with diffraction stack tecknique (see plot 9) The velocity-depth model used as input to the Kirchoff migration is displayed in PLOT
