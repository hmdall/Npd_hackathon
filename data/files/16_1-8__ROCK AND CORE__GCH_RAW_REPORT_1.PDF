Below are brief descriptions of procedures/analytical conditions. Sample preparation Cuttings samples are washed in water to remove mud. When oil based mud is used, soap (Zalo) is added to the sample and the sample is washed thoroughly in warm water to remove mud and soap. Extraction A Soxtec Tecator instrument is used. Thimbles are pre extracted in dichloromethane with 7% (vol/vol) methanol, 10 min boiling and 20 min rinsing. The crushed sample is weighed accurately in the pre extracted thimbles and boiled for hour and rinsed for hours in approximately 80 cc of dichloromethane with 7% (vol/vol) methanol. Copper blades activated in concentrated hydrochloric acid are added to the extraction cups to cause free sulphur to react with the copper. An aliquot of 10% of the extract is transferred to pre weighed bottle and evaporated to dryness. The amount of extractable organic matter is calculated from the weight of this 10% aliquot. Deasphaltening Extracts are evaporated almost to dryness before small amount of dichloromethane (3 times the amount of EOM) is added. Pentane is added in access (40 times the volume of EOM and dichloromethane/oil). The solution is stored for at least 12 hours in dark place before the solution is filtered or centrifuged and the weight of the asphaltenes measured. TOC A Leco CS-244 or CS-632 instrument is used.Diluted HCl is added to the crushed rock sample to remove carbonate. The sample is then introduced into the Leco combustion oven, and the amount of carbon in the sample is measured as carbon dioxide by an IR-detector. Rock-Eval, reservoir mode A Rock-Eval instrument is used. Jet-Rock is run as every tenth sample and checked against the acceptable range given in NIGOGA. Temperature programme Iatroscan An Iatroscan MK-5 (TLC/FID Analyser) instrument is used. l of extract or diluted oil is spotted on Chromarod S-III rods before elution in hexane (25 min), toluene (8 min) and dichloromethane with % methanol (vol/vol). The solvent is allowed to evaporate before the rods are placed into the next eluation chamber. Before running the rods in the analyser, the rods are heated for 90 sec. in heating chamber at 60 C. Density An Anton Parr instrument is used. Air and distilled water is used to calibrate the instrument. All measurements are done at 15C. NSO-1 is used as reference sample, and is run in each series of density measurements. If the viscosity of the oil is very high at 15C, gravimetric method is used. API gravity is calculated from the density. Page 51API Gravity () = 141.5/Density (g/cm3)  GC analysis of gas components Aliquots of the samples were transferred to exetainers. 0.1-1ml were sampled using Gerstel MPS2 autosampler and injected into Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II GC equipped with Porabond column, flame ionisation detector (FID), thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and methylization unit. Hydrocarbons were measured by FID, CO2 by metylization (to CH4) and then FID and N2 and O2 by TCD. Carbon isotope analysis of hydrocarbon compounds and CO2 The carbon isotopic composition of the hydrocarbon gas components was determined by GC-C-IRMS system. Aliquots were sampled with syringe and analysed on Trace GC2000, equipped with Poraplot column, connected to Delta plus XP IRMS. The components were burnt to CO2 and water in 1000 C furnace over Cu/Ni/Pt. The water was removed by Nafion membrane separation. Repeated analyses of standards indicate that the reproducibility of 13C values is better than %o PDB (2 sigma). Carbon isotope analysis of low concentration methane using the Precon. The carbon isotopic composition of methane was determined by Precon-IRMS system. Aliquots were sampled with GCPal autosampler. CO2, CO and water were removed on chemical traps. Other hydrocarbons than CH4 and remaining traces of CO2 were removed by cryotrapping. The methane was burnt to CO2 and water in 1000 C furnace over Cu/Ni/Pt. The water was removed by Nafion membrane separation. The sample preparation system described (Precon) was connected to Delta plus XP IRMS for  13C analysis. Repeated analyses of standards indicate that the reproducibility of 13C values is better than %o PDB (2 sigma). Hydrogen isotope analysis of methane The hydrogen isotopic composition of methane was determined by GC-C-IRMS system. Aliquots were sampled with GCPal and analysed on Trace GC2000, equipped with Poraplot column, connected to Delta plus XP IRMS. The components were decomposed to H2 and coke in 1400 C furnace. The international standard NGS-2 and an in-house standard (Std A) were used for testing accuracy and precision. The true value of NGS-2 is given to 172.5 %o V-SMOW (http://deuterium.nist.gov/standards.html). Repeated analyses of standards indicate that the reproducibility of D values is better than 10 %o PDB (2 sigma). Stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis of fractions The samples were dissolved in known amount of dichloromethane, and 4-5 mg of the sample (or as much as possible) was transferred to glass container. The solvent was evaporated in an oven at 50 C. CuO and some silver wires were added to the containers, which were then sealed by melting in vacuum. The samples were then combusted in an oven at 550 C for hour (Sofer, 1980). The combustion products CO2 and H2O were separated at 80C. Carbon isotopic composition of the CO2 aliquot was determined on Finnigan MAT 251 mass spectrometer. standard (NGS NSO-1, topped oil) is analysed for each 10th sample. The 13C value obtained for this standard is 28.77 %o PDB. The variation in the isotopic values for the standard by repeated analysis over period of five years is  %o. Page 52H2O(g) aliquot was reduced with Zn(s) to H2(g) and ZnO(s) in sealed, evacuated quartz vessels at 900 C. The 8D composition was determined by Finnigan MAT 251 mass spectrometer. Average analysed value for GISP from IAEA is 8DVSMOW=  %o (one standard deviation). Given value from IAEA is  %o. Stable carbon isotope analysis of kerogens The samples were weighed and transferred to 9x15 mm tin capsule. Approximately mg of the samples were used. The combustion of the samples in the presence of O2 and Cr2O3 at 1700 C was done in Carlo Erba NCS 2500 element analyser. Reduction of NOx to N2 was done in Cu oven at 650 C. H2O was removed in chemical trap of KMnO4 before separation of N2, CO2 and SO2 on Poraplot GC column. CO2 is flushed on-line in He flow to Micromass Optima, Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer for determination of 813C. A standard (USGS-24) is analysed for each 10th sample. The 13C value obtained for this standard is  %o PDB (one standard deviation). Given value from IAEA is  %o PDB (one standard deviation). GC of whole oil A HP5890 II instrument is used. The column is HP PONA, length 50 m, i.d. mm, film thickness m. 2,2,4-tri-methyl-pentane is used as an internal standard. (25 min.) GC of EOM fraction A HP5890 II instrument is used. The column is CP-Sil-5 CB-MS, length 60 m, i.d. mm, film thickness m. C20D42 is used as an internal standards. GC of saturated fraction GCMS of saturated and aromatic fractions A Micromass ProSpec high resolution instrument is used. The instrument is tuned to resolution of 3000 and data is acquired in Selected Ion Recording (SIR) mode. The column used is 60 CP-Sil-5 CB-MS with an i.d. of mm and film thickness m. D4-27R is used as internal standard when quantitative results are requested for the saturated compounds. D8-naphthalene and D10-phenanthrene are used as internal standards when quantitative results are required for the aromatic compounds.
