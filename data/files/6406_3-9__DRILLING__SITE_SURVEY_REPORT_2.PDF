Ice scour features are prevalent throughout the western and southern parts of the survey area, occuring at far lower frequency and magnitude over central and north-eastern regions, in which the T-Rex Proposed Location is situated. These ice scours take the form of irregular, linear depressions with maximum widths of up to about 200 metres and depths of up to eight metres; typical depths are about half this figure. The most common orientation for these features is south-west to north-east though in detail all orientations are seen. Several large isolated depressions, not associated with ice scour, have been identified within the low-lying, less scoured regions of the survey area. The largest of these depressions extends metres below the adjacent seabed depth and has diameter of 200 metres. Numerous shallow depressions are also observed within the central low- lying region of the survey area. The low-lying and less scoured region to the north-east features an undulating seabed with bathymetric highs orientated south-east to north-west. Correlation between bathymetric highs and high reflectivity patches seen on side scan sonar data have been found within this region. Mounds of sediment have been identified within the survey area but are absent from the west and south-western ice-scoured regions. Some sediment mounds are located within close proximity to possible coral and may therefore be indicative of further coral habitats. Numerous boulders are found at seabed, some in dense clusters. The closest boulder to the T-Rex Proposed Location measures by metres with height of metres and is located 150 metres to the west. Several debris items and two sections of wire have also been identified within the survey area. The closest debris item is located kilometres north-north-west of the T-Rex Proposed Location.SUMMARY OF SURVEY RESULTS T-REX PROPOSED LOCATION  CONTINUED Sub-seabed Conditions: Three pipelines and three cables are observed crossing the survey area. These are the Gas Export P-212 and A-103 pipelines, the Asgard Transport P-121 pipeline and the Tyrihans PC-201, D-101 and A-201 cables. All pipelines and cables in the area are intermittently exposed and gravel dumped. Some possible fishing gear extending 75 metres into the water column has been identified in the north of the survey area above the Tyrihans A-103 pipeline.

CLAYSTONE Note: depths are those at the T-Rex Proposed Location, time to depth conversion based on time/stacking velocity pairs from shotpoint 1651 on Line MAE103011-C-042.Installation Constraints: Anchoring Conditions The anchoring conditions across the survey area will be affected by the irregular topography (due to the presence of ice scour features) as well as by the profusion of cobbles and boulders at and below seabed. There is also the potential for significant variation in the geotechnical properties of the shallow soils. Habitat Investigation: Coarse Deposits and Boulders Cobbles and boulders occur in profusion at the seabed; they are likely to be just as numerous thoughout the Quaternary geological sequence (to depth of 1054 metres below seabed at the T-Rex Proposed Location). Shallow Gas All the available data have been assessed for seismic indicators of shallow gas down to approximately 1900 milliseconds TWTT. Anomalous features have been identified within the survey area and are summarised as follows: Feature Description Two-way Time [ms] (range within survey area) Probability of the Feature Representing Shallow Gas Proximity to T-Rex Proposed Location [m] High amplitude ice scour infill 668-743 High 300 SE Upper wedge high amplitude 705-960 Low 204 SE Obstructions Tyrihans PC-201, D-101 and A-201 cables. The closest pipeline to the T-Rex Proposed Location is the Gas Export P-212, which passes approximately 750 metres to the west. Occurrences of the stony coral Lophelia pertusa were to be classified into five categories (gravel, dead, poor, moderate and good), whilst the sediment type encountered across the survey area was separated into three types (soft sediments, mixed sediments and other corals). Analysis of the seabed photography data indicated that the seabed comprised thin veneer of soft sediment composed of sandy clay, which overlaid clay with occasional sand and gravel, as described in the seabed features. Mixed sediments, consisting of gravel, pebbles, cobbles and boulders were also evident, either on the berms of iceberg ploughmarks or in scattered patches throughout the survey area.Vulnerable Environmental Resources and Red List Species: Review of the side scan sonar data identified several irregular, high reflectivity mound features, typically located on the flanks of iceberg scours in the shallower (and therefore more heavily scoured) western and southern parts of the survey area. The majority of these features were located in relatively close proximity (<500 metres) to existing pipelines and, as such, were not subjected to further investigation. Photographic ground truthing on the edge of one of these features showed the presence of soft corals (Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) growing on dead Lophelia pertusa, with areas of Lophelia pertusa gravel in the vicinity. As such it is thought likely that this feature, and many of the other similar features identified from the side scan sonar record, comprise L. pertusa reefs, although it is not possible to comment on the quality / health of this or other suspected coral reefs. It should also be noted that some of the suspected coral reefs may in fact be mounds of glacial-derived boulders, which are known to occur in this region. No living stony coral (Lophelia pertusa) were evident from the seabed photography data. However, several features were identified from the side scan sonar records which were likely to comprise L. pertusa reefs, associated with the edges of iceberg scours in the west and south of the survey area. Lophelia pertusa reefs are classified as vulnerable environmental resources according to Section 51 of the Activities Regulations and the species itself is also listed on the Norwegian Red List. Two other Norwegian Red List soft coral species Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis were identified overgrowing dead L. pertusa coral. Areas of mixed sediment and isolated cobbles or boulders showed numerous attached sponges, none of which were identified as Norwegian Red List species.-rumen T-RIEX PROPOSED LOCRTFON (.1DTh   FORMATION SEQUENCE co Lia 4* PREDICTED PREDOMINANT LITHOLOGY GEOHAZARD PROGNOSIS Lothude: 8458' 04.548'N Longitude: CV 41'12.867'E Northing: 207 058 mN &Hang: 31110 SOS mE  co ro NAUST NAUST SEQUENCE LATE PLEISTOCENE QUATERNARY I-7n11 . _______ 1   ZR.Obil, dr. - . 23  105  177    10 Massive sandy CLAY wtth gravel and boulders; generally overconsolldated Ills *Hot sheDow gas, 300 metres aouth-aaat of Proposed Location Low !UR of shanow du, 204 metres south-east of Propoaed Location  620  15 Bedded sandy CLAY; less overconsolidated than upper tills r .., .. .... ._... - ii._ ...... ..1. .0. ... ...... - -':  ... # amingsb.4.440; um! ...  ... ........060...  649 .-a ci-   Massive sandy CLAY with gravel and boulders.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE OF WORK 1.1 General Project Description Fugro Survey Limited were contracted by Maersk Oil to undertake site survey in the PL- 431 licence area, NOCS 6406. The surveys were carried out by the MV Fugro Meridian; the main phase of acquisition was completed between 11 May and 29 May 2010 and CPT acquisition was completed between June and 15 June 2010. Side scan sonar acquisition was completed between 16 July and 29 July 2010. The Volume results report was submitted to Maersk Oil on 01/09/10, however on 16/11/10 Fugro were provided with revised proposed location positions by Maersk Oil. This volume contains results summaries for the final T-Rex Proposed Location and its two relief well locations. It should be regarded as companion to the main results volume, Volume 1. These summaries do contain some description of the geology of the broader survey area, but any reader seeking an overview of the area is referred to Volume 1, which contains charts and data examples over the entire area. When using Volume it is important to note that the latest positions included in this document (Volume 1a) are not included in any of Volume 1s content. The final T-Rex location is some kilometres north-east of the Proposed Location reported in Volume 1. Table.1.1: Proposed Location Coordinates Geodetic Datum ED50, UTM Zone 32N, 9E Location Latitude Longitude Easting [m] Northing [m] 1.2 Scope of Work The site survey consisted of seven kilometre by seven kilometre survey grid with reduced survey line length where the survey grid was bounded by the license boundary. The survey comprised analogue, digital and integrated analogue and digital survey lines. The digital survey covered three kilometre by three kilometre area in the centre of the survey grid, and consisted of 32 main lines spaced at 100 metres and orientated 030/210. The analogue survey covered seven kilometre by seven kilometre area but excluded the central three kilometres by three kilometres. The analogue survey consisted of single and multibeam echo sounder, side scan sonar, mini sleeve gun and hull-mounted pinger data. The analogue survey consisted of 40 main lines spaced at 100 metres, and orientated 030/210, and 16 cross lines spaced at 250 metres orientated 120/300. FSLTD/Report No 00285V1a.1 Page 16MAERSK OIL PL-431 DRILLING HAZARD AND HABITAT ASSESSMENT SURVEY MAE10301 The integrated analogue and digital survey covered the survey area of seven kilometres by seven kilometres with the exception of four two kilometre by two kilometre squares in each corner of the survey area which were covered by the analogue survey grid. The integrated survey consisted of 600 metre streamer and 140 in3 gun source for the seismic array, mini streamer, side scan sonar, hull- mounted pinger, single beam echo sounder and multibeam echo sounder data. The integrated survey consisted of 31 main lines spaced at 100 metres and orientated 030/210 and 13 cross lines spaced at 250 metres and orientated 120/300. tie-line orientated 174/354 was run from the site centre to a previous survey area. The integrated survey grid is displayed in Figure 1.1, Volume 1. Due to the digital and integrated survey grids being offset from each other, the central three kilometres by three kilometres of the survey grid has 50 metre line spacing in the mainline direction. Survey lines are of varying lengths due to the irregular shape of the survey grid, which was bounded by the license block boundary. The survey programme included habitat investigation utilising underwater video and still photography. The requirement for the habitat investigation is specified in Section 51 of The Activities Regulations which states that baseline surveys should be undertaken prior to exploration drilling in areas where the presence of particularly vulnerable environmental resources (including coral reefs and spawning grounds) has been established or where the presence of such resources is probable (Petroleum Safety Authority Norway Website). In addition an assessment was also made as to whether any Norwegian Red List species were present within the survey area, in particular hard corals (Scleractinia), soft corals (Gorgonacea) and sponges (Porifera).
