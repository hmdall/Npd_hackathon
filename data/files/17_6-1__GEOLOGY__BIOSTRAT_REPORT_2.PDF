The top of the Balder Fm. was defined by the client at 716m. The content of the 716m cuttings sample is representative of beds at and above this depth, i.e. between 716m and up to the next sample above. Reworking: No obvious reworking Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna is composed of frequent non-pyritised spumellarians, rare agglutinated foraminifera and rare undifferentiated pyritised Coscinodiscus spp. Palynology comments: The 716m sample was poor in palynomorphs in general, and the recovered palynomorphs are mixed from beds of different ages (Eocene-Oligocene). This is probably result from the drilling of the casing cement. The sample is however fairly rich in Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, dinocyst species that has its main distribution in the Balder Formation. It may also be common in the upper Sele Formation and it may further be present in the basal part of the Hordaland Gp. The low pollen content in this sample is however not in accordance with the Balder and the Sele Formations, and hence the basal part of the Horda Fm (early Early Eocene) is considered most likely Recovery and preservation: Poor organic recovery and mixed assemblages due to content of casing cement.

The Balder Fm. may be present between the two analysed samples 716 and 745m, which is likely from the log signature, and the majority of the Sele Fm. is probably present between 745 and 775m Micropaleontology comments: The LO/LO of frequent pyritised Fenestrella antiqua indicate penetration of the Rogaland Group and earliest Eocene - latest Palaeocene sediments. Palynology comments: The sample yielded superabundant Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, dinocyst species that has its main distribution in the Balder Formation. It may also be common in the upper Sele Formation and it may further present in the basal part of the Hordaland Gp. The high pollen content, especially of Caryapollenites spp. in this sample is strongly associated with the Balder and the Sele Formations. Cerodinium wardenense has its main distribution in the lower part of the Balder Fm., and it may penetrate the upper SeleFm. The acme in Pterospermella spp., large forms is closely associated with the upper Sele Fm, biozone TP5b1. However, other markers for the deeper part of the Sele Fm, like Cerodinium dartmoorium and Apectodinium spp. are not observed in this well.

The income of common calcareous benthonic foraminifera at 805m may suggest some decrease in water depth from above. Stratigraphic comment: The interval is attributed to the lower Lista Fm. This will say that the majority of the Sele Fm. and the upper Lista Fm/Heimdal equivalent should be present between 775m and the next sample above at 745m. We suspect an unconformity in the spacing between these two samples. The lithostratigraphic correspondence of the TP3a zone (830-860m) is problematic. In the type well for the Vle Fm., Norwegian well 1/3-1, the TP3a zone is clearly present from the top of the Vle Fm. In the Danish sector the zone is located in the lower Lista Fm., the Vile Mbr., and since the latter seems to be generally accepted in regionally simplified lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic correlation, we tentatively leave the zone within the Lista Fm.Reworking: Reworking of Jurassic palynomorphs was noted at 830m. Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna in the uppermost sample at 775m is composed of diatoms, spumellarians, sparse agglutinated foraminifera and rare calcareous benthonic foraminifera. The entrance of common calcareous benthonic foraminifera with LO of Stensioeina beccariiformis at 805m marks presence of microzone Tm5 and Selandian aged sediments, attributed to the lower part of Lista Formation. Rare planktonic foraminifera is entering in the lowermost sample at 860m with presence of single specimen of Globorotalia pseudobulloides and ?Eoglobigerina spp., which may be assigned to tentative microzone Tm4 and basal Selandian age. Palynology comments: Abundant Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum was met from 775m, together with regular Alisocysta margarita and Thalassipora cf delicata. Areoligera gippingense was not recorded, indicating that the interval belongs to the lower parts of the Late Paleocene (lower Lista Fm), and that there is chance that there is hiatus between 775 and 745m. The TP3a zone of the earliest late paleocene is well documented from 830m by the LO and regular presence of Isabelidinium? viborgense. Recovery and preservation: rich recovery of well preserved palynomorphs. 890m Early Paleocene 890dcs TP2b Alisocysta reticulata LO 890dcs Planktonic foraminifera LCO Depositional environment: Marine, bathyal - outer shelf environment Stratigraphic comment: This sample is attributed to the basal Rogaland Gp., the Vle Fm. See discussion for the above interval. The entrance of chalk in the micropalaeontological residues might support penetration of Shetland Group if other evidence suggests this. Reworking: No obvious Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna is dominated by calcareous benthonic foraminifera and planktonic foraminifera. Palynology comments: The LO in Alisocysta reticulata at 890m is good evidence for the upper part of the Early Paleocene (Danian). This form was recorded as common at 923m, where it is supposed caved. Recovery and preservation: Moderately rich assemblages that are mostly well preserved.

Micropaleontology comments: The LO of Pseudotextularia elegans and Bolivinoides draco provide evidence for penetration of Maastrichtian sediments. The interval is assigned general Maastrichtian - Campanian age since the Campanian can not be excluded for the lower part of the interval. The fauna through the interval is dominated by calcareous benthonic and planktonic foraminifera. Events to note include the entrance of abundant Inoceramus prisms at 950m, LCO of Rugoglobigerina rugosa at 1045m and the LO of keeled planktonic foraminifera at 1076m. Palynology comments: The palynological analyses did not contribute to this interval, most likely due to unfavourable limestone facies Recovery and preservation: Poor recovery (cavings?) or barren 1139m  1170m Santonian 1139dcs Cm34 Large, non-pyr.

Micropaleontology comments: The top entrance of common to abundant large, non-pyritised spumellarians at 1139m, combined with frequent keeled planktonic foraminifera, is taken as ReportNumber Page 10evidence for penetration of Santonian sediments. The LO/LO frequent occurrence of ?Stensioeina granulata polonica in the sample at 1170m provide tentative support to the assignment which if true specimens indicate presence of Middle - Early Santonian sediments and microzone Cm33-32 at this depth.

LO Stratigraphic comment: The interval is from biostratigraphical interpretation attributed to the Hod Fm. A hiatus or condensed interval is proposed at the base of this interval, between 1225 and 1255m, where at least the Turonian is thin or missing. The clients interpretation indicates the top of the Blodks Formation at 1218.5m. The biostratigraphy indicates the Blodks for the 1255m sample. Micropaleontology comments: The LCO of Globotruncana/Marginotruncana spp. at 1197m suggest penetration of Coniacian - Turonian sediments, taken as most likely Coniacian based on the general faunal composition and absence of Turonian markers. Of note is entrance of dark gray claystone in the micropalaeontological residues at 1225m. Palynology comments: The 1197m sample is the uppermost palynologically productive sample from the Shetland Gp. in this well, and it shows LO in Heterosphaeridium difficile, robust forms. This would suggest beds of Coniacian- Turonian age. The presence of Senoniasphaera sp. DGU at 1225m favours Coniacian age since this distinct form has not been reported outside the Coniacian. The recorded palynomorph assemblage at 1225m has much in common with that published from the Arnager limestone Fm. on Bornholm. The Early Coniacian seems to not have been penetrated because of the lack of Chatangiella spinosa. This negative evidence is however not 100% reliable since this locality is south of the major Chatangiella province. ReportNumber Page 11Recovery and preservation: Moderate to good recovery at 1197, excellent at 1225m.

Blodks Fm, based on the age of the sample and the common presence of sapropelic materials that are indicative of the anoxic oceanic event close to the Cenomanian- Turonian boundary. A hiatus or condensed interval is proposed at the top of this interval, between 1225 and 1255m, where at least the Turonianis is thin or missing. Likewise the Middle to Early Cenomanian may be thin or missing between 1255 and 1287m. Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna is composed of planktonic foraminifera, rare calcareous benthonic foraminifera, slight increase in agglutinated forms from above and spumellarians. Of note is an increase in organic rich sediments in the microfaunal residues and entrance of in part glassy spheres, most likely spumellarians, speckled with dark material of possible organic origin. Palynology comments: The 1255m sample is characterised by high content of sapropelic organic materials and the key fossils Litosphaeridium siphoniphorum, Endoceratium dettmanniae and Maghrebinia membraniphora (common). This combined kerogen and palynomorph assemblage is strongly associated with the Blodks Fm., and it is registered on wide regional scale. Recovery and preservation: The preservation and the recovery are good in this sample.

The sample at 1287m provides first downhole biostratigraphic evidence for an Early Cretaceous age, the age of the interval may suggest presence of Rdby Fm. The Middle and the Early Albian are not positively identified. Beds of these ages may be thin or missing between 1312 and 1338m. Micropaleontology comments: Microfauna composed of planktonic foraminifera, calcareous benthonic foraminifera, agglutinated forms, radiolaria and Inoceramus prisms, with increase in agglutinated forms in the lowermost sample at 1312m. No forms restricted to Early Cretaceous are noted in the uppermost sample at 1287m, the sample at 1312m include the LO of Textularia ?bettenstaedti which is consistent with the Early Cretaceous age assigned from palynology. Palynology comments: The LO in Apteodinium grande at 1287m, and the subsequent LO of Odontochitina singhii and acme in at 1312m, indicate the presence of fairly complete Late Albian interval. Additional observations like common Cribroperidinium edwardsii and Oligosphaeridium complex, and abundant Surculosphaeridium longifurcatum, are considered good support for the penetration of the Early Cretaceous Late Albian.

ReportNumber Page 13Micropaleontology comments: The fauna is composed of planktonic foraminifera, calcareous benthonic foraminifera and agglutinated forms. Rare spumellarians are noted in the uppermost sample, however, the occurrence may be caved. The presence of single specimen of Epistomina ?caracolla, Verneuilinoides aff. chapmani and Uvigerinammina/Falsogaudryinella spp. is consistent with the Early Cretaceous age assigned from palynology. In the sample at 1367m small light brown Hedbergella spp. is entering with frequent occurrence in the lowermost sample at 1399m. Palynology comments: The abundance in Ellipsoidictyum imperfectum and E.imperfectum glabrum together with LO/LCO in Cerbia tabulata, LO in Dingodinium albertii , LO in Nyktericysta?

The abundance in sapropelic organic material in the sample is taken as evidence for distinct anoxic oceanic event that is usually included in the Early Aptian. Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna in the sample is characterised by abundant small light brown Hedbergella spp. and top frequent Gavelinella spp. Palynology comments: The 1429m sample is characterised by abundance in sapropelic organic materials that are taken as representative of the wide spread Early Aptian OAE (oceanic anoxic event). An early Aptian age is palynologically indicated by the acme in Cerbia tabulata in the same sample, and the LO in Trichodinium speetonense. Pseudoceratium specimen with close resemblance to P. pelliferum was also recorded at 1429m. P. pelliferum as such is not known to range up into the Aptian, but there are similar forms reported from Aptian beds in Greenland for instance. In Spitsbergen the Aptian OAE strata are rich in P. pelliferum like forms. Samples from the Barremian interval below are also rich in sapropel, which is supposed to ReportNumber Page 14represent caving. 1457m  1520m Barremian 1457dcs CP5c Heslertonia heslertonenesis LO/LCO 1457dcs CP5c Sirmiodinium grossii LO/LCO 1491dcs CP5c Achomosphaera neptunii LO 1491dcs CP5c Batioladinium micropodum LO 1520dcs CP5c Pseudoceratium pelliferum LRO/?LO 1520dcs CP5c Cassiculosphaeridia magna LO/LCO Depositional environment: Marine, shelf environment abundance in sapropelic organic materials at 1520m may suggest presence of Munk Marl Bed at this depth. Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna in the interval is composed of calcareous benthonic foraminifera, agglutinated foraminifera and planktonic foraminifera in the upper two samples. No Barremian marker taxa are noted. Palynology comments: The penetration of definite Barremian beds is taken by the LO and LRO of Sirmiodinium grossii at 1457m. This form is also known to occur in the earliest Aptian. Firm evidence was obtained at 1520m, by the LO in Cassiculosphaeridia magna and the LRO in Pseudoceratium pelliferum. The 1520 and the 1457m samples were also characterised by abundance in sapropelic organic materials, which is unusual for the Barremian. This organic facies is more associated with the lower Aptian anoxic event. We see this as result of caving, at least at 1520m, but it may also eventually be taken as an expression of the Munk Marl Beds 1553m  1646m Early Barremian  Late Hauterivian 1553dcs Epistomina spp. LCO 1553dcs Epistomina caracolla LO confident 1553dcs Lenticulina ouachensis wisselmanni LO 1553dcs Lenticulina spp. LCO 1553dcs Inoceramus prisms re-entrance, ABU 1553dcs CP5b Batioladinium longicornutum LO 1553dcs CP5b Kleithriasphaeridium corrugatum LO 1610dcs CP4b2 Pseudoceratium pelliferum LCO 1610dcs CP4b2 Muderongia tetracantha LO ReportNumber Page 15Norwegian well 17/6-1 Routine Biostratigraphy Report 1610dcs CP Hystricodinium pulchrum LCO/LAO 1610dcs Chlamydophorella trabeculosa LCO 1610dcs Oligosphaeridium asterigerum LAO 1646dcs Megaspores LRO/LCO 1646dcs Epistomina caracolla frequent age of the interval may suggest penetration of sgard Fm.

Stratigraphic comment: Undifferentiated Cromer Knoll Gp. at 1m from client interpretation. Top Boknfjord Gp., Flekkefjord Fm (client) is taken at 2020m based on combination of paleontological/log evidence. There are increased amounts of amorphous organic material downhole from 1970m, but gradual downhole increase is seen already from 1910m, and hence the transition to the Sauda Fm. may be difficult to define on kerogen data. This amorphous organic event is associated with the penetration of the Sauda Formation at 2020m (client data) and is dated by palynology as an intra-Late Ryazanian event well documented from the literature as mid- stenomphalus ammonite event. Micropaleontology comments: The microfauna in the two uppermost samples is dominated by calcareous benthonic and agglutinated foraminifera. The LO/LO of frequent large Haplophragmoides spp. including Haplophragmoides aff.canui at 1970m and the LO of Haplophragmoides aff.infracalloviensis at 2001m is taken as microfaunal evidence for presence of sediments no younger than Ryazanian. The agglutinated fauna is also characterised by frequent large Haplophragmium spp. at 1970m and presence of Verneuilinoides spp., Trochammina spp. and Ammobaculites spp. The microfauna in the sample at 2021m is dominated by small, flat, in part pyritised Trochammina spp. with presence of Verneuilinoides spp., Haplophragmium spp., Recurvoides spp. and rare large Haplophragmoides spp. There is decreased abundance in calcareous benthonic foraminifera from above. The sample at 2021m is the lowermost sample analysed for micropaleontology in well 17/6-1. Palynology comments: The common occurrence of Oligosphaeridium diloculum and ReportNumber Page 18Circulodinium comptum at 2021m suggests penetration of zone Cp1a which is equivalent to the lower part of the stenomphallus and iceni ammonite zones. This is confirmed by the presence of the index species Batioladinium radiculatum at 2036m and Daveya boreasphaera at 2051m. The latter species is probably confined to the stenomphallus ammonite zone of the Late Ryazanian. There is an increase in Stiphrosphaeridium dictyophorum at 2141m.

The presence of the Late Volgian is uncertain. If it is missing then an unconformity is implied between the Ryazanian and the Volgian. Reworking: Sporadic records of Chasmatosporites spp. are derived from the Middle Jurassic- Late Triassic. Ricciisporites spp at 2126m is derived from Hettangian-Late Triassic deposits. Palynology comments: The events given above imply penetration of the Early Ryazanian or older. The Stiphrosphaeridium dictyophorum acme (common but not abundant) is at 2111m and this is an event associated with the Early Ryazanian. This species is also moderately common at 2096m and this might imply that Early Ryazanian extends up to this level. In the absence of good index species above 2111m this level is taken as the top Early Ryazanian. An increase in Pterospermella / Tasmanites at 2171m (though no clear acme or maximum is seen) may indicate the presence of Late Volgian as would the record of Gochteodinia virgula though this is only questionable occurrence. Penetration of the Late Volgian is uncertain as good markers are lacking.

Prasinophycid alga (mostly Tasmanites spp) are common. These characteristics are consistent with penetration of the Tau Formation which is usually of Early Volgian or Late Kimmeridgian age.

Palynology comments: The ABN occurrence of Mendicodinium groenlandicum throughout this interval indicates Late Callovian age. The COM occurrence of Meiourogonyaulax caytonensis group at 2615m is consistent with the assigned age. The presence of Energlynia acollaris at 2627m and 2630m supports Late Callovian age as this form is generally not ReportNumber Page 22considered to range below that age. Similarly the LO of Vallensiella ovula at 2630m supports at Callovian age as it characteristically occurs in sediments of that age. The presence of rare Wanaea fimbriata between 2615m and 2624m may represent some caving as this taxon is generally considered to be restricted to the Early Oxfordian, Biozone Pj9(2) . Support for this possibility is provided by the presence of some definite caving within this interval. 2633m  2642m Callovian 2633dcs Reduction in age diagnostic palynomorphs 2642dcs Base consistent / common Callovian or younger palynomorphs P Depositional environment: Marine, shelf with restricted bottom waters. Stratigraphic comment: Sandnes Formation (clients preliminary data). Because of the limited age control the nature of the boundary between the Sandnes and underlying Bryne formations is unclear but in the absence of any other information it has been left as conformable one. Palynology comments: There are subtile changes in the palynofloras from this interval compared to the overlying one with reduction in the numbers of Rigaudella aemula, Acanthaulax senta and Mendicodinium groenlandicum and with increases in the sporomorphs Araucariacites australis, Callialasporites dampieri and Corollina spp. Rare Dichadogonyaulax spp. occur at and below 2636m. Definite caving occurs within this interval represented by the occurrence of Gonyaulacysta jurassica var. longicornis at 2633m and Wanaea fimbriata at 2636m and 2639m, both Oxfordian markers. In the absence of any new restricted Callovian forms and the uncertainty of which palynomorphs are in situ and which are caved general Callovian age has been assigned to this interval. 2648m  2717m Bathonian - Aalenian 2648dcs Deltoidospora minor LAO 2654dcs Chasmatosporites spp. LO 2657dcs Quadraeculina anellaeformis LO Depositional environment: Fluvial/deltaic. Reworking: Spelaeotriletes spp. at 2690m suggests some probable Carboniferous reworking as this genus is most characteristic of that age but can occur from the Devonian. questionable Emphanisporites spp. at 2699m may possibly suggest some Devonian recycling. Stratigraphic comment: In the absence of any indication of Late Toarcian strata an unconformity is suggested between this and the underlying interval at 2726m. ReportNumber Page 23Bryne Formation (clients preliminary data). Palynology comments: major change in the palynofloras occurs at and below 2648m with the LAO of the miospore Deltoidospora minor and consequential reduction in bisaccate pollen. The LOs of Chasmatosporites spp. and Quadraeculina anellaeformis at 2654m and 2657m suggest an age no younger than Bathonian. The rich assemblages of palynomorphs are dominated by D. minor with subordinate bisaccate pollen and rarer numbers of Araucariacites australis, Baculatisporites spp., Callialasporites dampieri, Cerebropollenites mesozoicus, Corollina spp., Deltoidospora australis, Inaperturopollenites spp., Osmundacidites spp., Perinopollenites elatoides and Retitriletes spp. This association is typical of that expected from the Bryne Formation, which regionally can range from the Aalenian to Bathonian. The dominance of D. minor may suggest possible Bajocian age as it is most typical of that age but can occur in both younger and older sediments. Accordingly in the absence of any short ranging age diagnostic taxa broad Aalenian to Bathonian age is assigned. Rare Botryococcus spp. and Micrhystridium spp. are also recorded indicating some saline influence within this interval. Common caving is recorded from this interval represented by Middle/Late Jurassic and Cretaceous dinocysts.

Stratigraphic comment: Fjerritslev Formation (clients preliminary data). Palynology comments: The frequent occurrence of sphaeromorph clusters at 2726m and the subsequent LO of Luehndea spinosa at 2735m indicate an age within the range Late Pliensbachian to Early Toarcian. reversion back to bisaccate dominated assemblages occurs in this interval compared to those from the overlying Bryne Formation. A fresh to brackish water influence is indicated at 2726m with the common occurrence of Botryococcus spp., while limited marine influence is noted at the same depth with the presence of rare Nannoceratopsis gracilis, N. senex and the sphaeromorph clusters. An increased marine influence occurs at and below 2735m with significant increase in N. gracilis and N. senex. ReportNumber Page 24A single Kraeuselisporites reissingeri at 2744m may represent sporadic occurrence, rarely seen in the Late Pliensbachian or be the result of reworking. 2753m  2849m Late Pliensbachian 2753dcs Pj3 Cerebropollenites thiergartii LO / constant 2753dcs Nannoceratopsis triceras LO 2813dcs Fentonia bjaerkei LO Reworking: Rare Carboniferous reworking occurs within this interval represented by Densosporites spp. at 2753m, 2807m and 2849m and Lycospora spp. at 2789m. Palynology comments: The top consistent and LO of Cerebropollenites thiergartii at 2753m suggests an age no younger than Late Pliensbachian. Rich assemblages of palynomorphs occur throughout this interval. The palynofloras are dominated by bisaccate pollen with subordinate Deltoidospora minor. Also present are rarer but variable numbers of Araucariacites australis, Baculatisporites spp., Cerebropollenites thiergartii, Chasmatosporites major and spp., Corollina torosus and spp., Nannoceratopsis gracilis, N. senex, Osmundacidites spp., Perinopollenites elatoides, Quadraeculina anellaeformis and Retitriletes spp. This association is consistent with the assigned age. Frequent definite caving is represented by the presence of Middle Jurassic and younger dinocysts. Accordingly the FOs of number of taxa, including N. gracilis, N. senex and N. triceras, which occur within the Late Pliensbachian, cannot be used with any confidence in this well. Slight increases in Botryococcus spp. occur between 2762m  2771m and 2822m  2831m. These may be weak reflections of the re-entry of COM Botryococcus spp. which is an intra Late Pliensbachian event. The presence of the dinocyst Fentonia bjaerkei at 2813m and 2822m is consistent with the assigned age as it is considered not to range below the late Early Pliensbachian. 2858m  2975m Early Pliensbachian - Sinemurian 2858dcs Pj3 Kraeuselisporites reissingerii single 2858dcs Baculatisporites spp. very COM 2921dcs Perinopollenites elatoides ABN 2975dcs Kraeuselisporites reissingerii reappearance Depositional environment: Marginal marine. Because of the presence of definite caved palynomorphs within the microfloras from this interval it is difficult to assess if the rare saline influences, which have been used to define the palaeodepositional setting, present in most samples are definitely in situ or could also be the result of caving. ReportNumber Page 25Lycospora spp. at 2858m and 2876m, Cingulizonates spp., Tripartites spp. at 2867m and Densosporites spp. between 2876m and 2921m. Triassic reworking is represented by single Triancoraesporites ancorae at 2867m. ?Zebrasporites laevigatus at 2921m and 2939m is also thought to represent Triassic reworking. Palynology comments: The very common occurrence of Baculatisporites spp. at and below 2858m, by regional comparisons, is thought to represent an intra Pliensbachian event, which has previously been taken to represent the boundary between the Early and Late Pliensbachian. The subsequent ABN occurrence of Perinopollenites elatoides at 2921m has previously been observed in Sinemurian  Early Pliensbachian interval. The presence of single Kraeuselisporites reissingerii at 2858m gives some limited support for the penetration of Early Pliensbachian strata where irregular records are recorded, while its reappearance at 2975m again gives some limited support for an Early Sinemurian or older age as its consistent occurrence is considered to indicate that age. A very poorly preserved palynomorph at 2966m is questionably assigned to the dinocyst Dapcodinium priscum, which if correct would give some limited support to an Early Sinemurian or older age for the lower part of this interval. The palynofloras are dominated by bisaccate pollen and Deltoidospora minor and at and below 2921m Perinopollenites elatoides. The remainder of the assemblages are similar to those in the overlying interval with most of the forms continuing through from higher up the well. Again significant definite caving is represented by the presence of Middle Jurassic and younger dinocysts making the FOs of taxa unusable in this section. 2984m  3065m Hettangian Depth Biozone Bioevent and type 2984dcs Pj1 Trachysporites fuscus LO 2984dcs Kraeuselisporites reissingeri FREQ Depositional environment: Marginal marine. similar problem occurs regarding caving as discussed in the overlying interval.

There is no evidence that the Skagerrak Formation has been penetrated but as Skagerrak deposits are generally poorly productive or barren, the assemblages may be caved. Densosporites spp. at 2984m. Palynology comments: The present of the events listed above suggests penetration of Hettangian strata at 2984m. questionable Ovalipollis ovalis at 2993m gives some limited support for Hettangian or older age. Trachysporites fuscus occurs consistently between 2984m and 3011m supporting the assigned age. ReportNumber Page 26There is reduction in recovery in the samples from this interval although 200 palynomorph count was achieved in most palynofloras. Bisaccate pollen, Deltoidospora minor and Perinopollenites elatoides dominate the assemblages. An increase in definite caved palynomorphs occurs at and below 3020m making age determination problematic. However, in the absence of any restricted Triassic markers this interval has been retained within the Early Jurassic, Hettangian.
