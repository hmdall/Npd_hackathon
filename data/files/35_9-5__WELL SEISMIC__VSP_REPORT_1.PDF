Toolstring run as per toolsketch. Bottom log interval was 3510m; top log interval was 1105.6m. There were no good first arrivals witnessed on axis in upper section of 9in casing probably caused by bad coupling between casing and borehole, cement bond log to be investigated to verify. Transit times picking in this area were done using mostly & axis, these are only field picks. Max recorded temperatures from thermometers in LEH 103deg C.
