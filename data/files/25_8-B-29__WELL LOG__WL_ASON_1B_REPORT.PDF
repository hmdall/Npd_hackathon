DCS, Stavanger Page 2, Revision March 2003Summary Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) data in different modes, Monopole (Compressional &Shear), Stoneley and Cross Dipole (BCR) were acquired in the well Jotun 25/8-B-29. The data were processed using the GeoFrame sonic anisotropy processing modules. Both time-domain and frequency-domain analysis was carried out to identify shear anisotropy and to distinguish the type of anisotropy. The DSI data and GPIT data acquired in the well are of good quality except for some monopole contamination in some intervals due to tool eccentricity because of the high borehole deviation. The shales in the intervals 2815-2850 and 2915-2950 exhibit large shear anisotropy. Frequency domain analysis indicated that this anisotropy is mainly intrinsic, related to the shale layering. Sands in the interval 3057-3067 also show small intrinsic anisotropy. The sand in the interval 3160-3200 is isotropic. No stress related anisotropy is evidentin the well. DCS, Stavanger Page 3, Revision March 20031. Introduction Anisotropic formations show variation of properties in differing directions. Acoustic anisotropy is recognized as important in seismic applications. Acoustic anisotropy can be either intrinsic or stress induced. Intrinsic anisotropy is caused by bedding, microstructure, or aligned fractures. Stress-induced anisotropy and stress direction is important for geomechanics applications. The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) can provide capability to measure shear anisotropy. The measurement mode is called Both Cross Receiver (BCR) mode. Traditional processing is performed in the time domain and yields information about the isotropic and anisotropic nature of the formation. We used advanced frequencydomain processing of cross dipole data to distinguish the type of anisotropy as intrinsic or stress induced. In BCR mode, there are four firings and waveform acquisitions at each depth: upper dipole inline, upper dipole crossline, lower dipole inline, and lower dipole cross line. total of 32 waveforms are acquired as each depth level. The DSI was used to record cross-dipole data in the interval from 2670- 3220 in the Jotun 25/8-B-29 well. The data is processed in time domain as well as frequency- domain to produce the following outputs: 1. Azimuth of the anisotropy. 2. Minimum and maximum crossline energy. 3. % Anisotropy in time and in slowness 4. Fast and Slow shear slownesses 5. Dispersion plots DCS, Stavanger Page 4, Revision March 20032. Acquisition details The DSI was logged in Monopole (MPS), Stoneley and BCR modes. The tool was run with centralizer in inches borehole with OBM mud (density g/cm3). Maximum deviation over the logged interval was 65.5deg. 3. Data Quality The DSI data in the well is in general of good quality. The log shows in some interval monopole contamination due to tool eccentralization because of the high deviation (65 deg). Two runs in hole were made with the DSI tool. The sequences of events related to acquisition are given in Appendix-1. The field labeling of shear is affected by the presence of dual arrival at some places due monopole contamination. 4. Inclinometry Survey (GPIT) Anisotropy computation requires inclinometry data provided by the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT). Tool orientation is defined by three parameters: tool deviation, tool azimuth and relative bearing. These measurements allow an accurate positioning of the tool in the magnetic earth field reference. The GPIT uses three-axis magnetometer and three-axis accelerometer to accurately define the tool system of axis with respect to the earth's gravity (G) and magnetic field norm (F). Since both vectors (G and F) are well defined within the earth's system, relation can be established between the tool system and that of the earth. Checks of the magnetometer and accelerometer data are therefore vital for achieving high confidence in anisotropy results. These checks are made by calculating gravity, magnetic inclination and magnetic field, using the tool accelerometer and magnetometer data and crosschecking against the IGM calculated norms for the well location. Tolerance levels are:  Magnetic Field calculated from GPIT data within +/- %.  Magnetic Inclination calculated from GPIT data within +/- deg.  Gravity calculated from GPIT data within +/- %. Magnetic field (FNOR), magnetic inclination (FINC) and gravity (ANOR) calculated from the GPIT data are within acceptable tolerance levels, when compared to IGM norms (Figures and 2). DCS, Stavanger Page 5, Revision March 20035. DSI Shear Anisotropy Processing A shear (or flexural) wave, such as the ones generated by dipole source, will split as it propagates along the borehole and give fast shear wave and slow shear wave polarized along the anisotropy axis. With the availability of two sets of dipole transmitters and receivers in orthogonal directions, the Dipole Shear Sonic Imager Tool can measure the shear slowness in different directions in plane perpendicular to the tool axis. The full evaluation requires recording the waveforms on an axis parallel with the transmitter axis, but also in the perpendicular direction or cross direction. The BCR acquisition mode of the DSI consists of two firings each of two orthogonal dipole transmitters recorded by two arrays of orthogonal dipole receivers. Four- component data is obtained which consists of inline and cross-component waveforms from the two orthogonal, collocated dipole sources and the array of seven orthogonal dipole receiver pairs. These data are then processed to obtain the fast and slow shear slowness logs, and the azimuth of fast shear. The waveforms are rotated to find the azimuth for which the energy of the shear wave at the cross receiver is minimum. The shear wave at this azimuth is compared with the one in the perpendicular direction, if it arrives earlier, then this is the fast shear azimuth. Otherwise the fast shear azimuth is the perpendicular direction since the fast and slow shear directions are perpendicular. The tool orientation measured by general inclinometry device is then used to obtain the fast shear azimuth with respect to true North. Fast and slow shear velocities can then be evaluated using the STC processing on the rotated waveforms (Kimball and Marzetta, 1984). Processing chain in GeoFrame is as shown in Figure-11 5.1. Shear Azimuth uncertainty resolution 1. Determine the principal direction (+/- 90deg) from the minimum of the cross energy (energy anisotropy), 2. Rotate the waveforms to the principal directions 3. Cross correlate the rotated waveforms to determine which direction arrives first - this is the fast shear (time anisotropy). 4. Process the fast and slow waveforms with STC/BestDT to determine the fast and slow shear slownesses and the slowness anisotropy. 5. Anisotropy post process computes the slowness-based anisotropy and time- based anisotropy by the following equations: AN IDT = (DT slow - DT fast)/ ((DT slow + DT fast)/2)*100.0 DCS, Stavanger Page 6, Revision March 2003ANI TT = TT Diff / TT Fast *100 Where: A IDT: Slowness-based anisotropy ANI TT: Time-based anisotropy DT fast: Fast shear slowness DT slow: Slow shear slowness TT Diff: Arrival time difference between fast and slow shears waves TT Fast: Fast shear arrival time If there is little difference in arrival time (very little shear anisotropy < 5%) the determination in step can be ambiguous and can lead to 90 deg ambiguity. This mainly comes from road noise inherent to any sonic logging, which effect is usually not noticeable except when looking at very small time difference. 6. Acquisition and Processing Quality Control 6.1. Tool Centalization The DSI transmitter-receiver system has to be centered to obtain good quality shear data. Eccentering of the transmitters causes other modes to be excited in addition to the flexural mode. Eccentering of the receivers allows some of the other modes to be included in the recorded waveforms. The use of standoffs and centralizers reduces any monopole signal and increases the flexural signal. Each DSI receiver is in pair of receivers and the net receiver signal from dipole transmitter is maximum when receivers signals are coherent. But when they are not coherent, the signal content is reduced, and the noise remains the same (SNR is reduced). To maximize the signal:  Both receivers must have the same sensitivity (gain and phase)  Both receivers must be equidistant from the borehole The first problem is addressed by matching receiver pairs during the factory calibration, and by checking the receivers in the field before every job. The second problem is addressed by centralizing the tool. When DSI is run with standoffs, as in this case, the recommendation is to use the maximum achievable standoff. The ability to rotate the waveforms to minimize the minimum cross-line energy is the best QC to check the validity of the data and the model. In an isotropic zone, the fast- shear polarization direction has no meaning, since shear waves propagate with the same velocity for all propagation directions. If the formation, or the borehole, is severely inhomogeneous and disorderly, then the anisotropy logs may not correspond to any intrinsic or structural property of the rocks. The anisotropy logs should be DCS, Stavanger Page 7, Revision March 2003interpreted only in the zones where the anisotropy indicators are high, and the azimuth uncertainty indicator is low (i.e. the reliability is high). 7. Description of the anisotropy log presentation Figures to show the DSI anisotropy logs and dispersion plots (frequency-domain processing) for the well Jotun 25/8-B-29. Briefly, the log is constructed as five-track presentation as follows; the depth-track displays anisotropy indicators, track one correlation and quality curves, track two the fast-shear polarization direction, track three the slowness curves and track four the rotated waveforms. Each small vertical division is m. Track-1. Depth, Minimum cross-line energy (Minxen), Maximum cross-line energy (Maxxen ) and Offline energy(g reen shading in between Minxen and Maxxen Small minimum energy and large maximum energy together indicate an anisotropic zone. Both minimum and maximum energies are plotted as percent of the total energy in all four components. Track-2. Gamma Ray, Hole iameter, Hole azimuths and Sonde Deviation Track-3. Fast shear azimuth and azimuth uncertainty Fast shear azimuth, is the azimuth estimated from all seven receiver stations simultaneously, and the shaded region around it, Azimuth Uncertainty, indicates the average spread of the azimuths estimated from each dipole station individually. At depths where the anisotropy is low, the uncertainty becomes large because angles obtained from receiver pairs are highly influenced by noise rather than the formation. Track-4. Shear slownesses derived from the rotated waveforms (slow shear and fast shear). Time based anisotropy and slowness based anisotropy as described in sec 4.0. Track-5. The fast and slow shear waveforms, together with the processing time window, are shown in track four at every 3m. These are the waveforms at the last receiver station after four-component rotation with the corresponding fast shear azimuth. Note that the two waveforms, when anisotropy is present, are time shifted. 8. DSI anisotropy interpretation Some zones have been identified of interest, where the data quality is good and the minimum energy is close to zero (no contamination, as discussed earlier). The shale interval at 2815-2850m (Figure 3&4) and 2915-2950m (Figure 5&6) are anisotropic; showing large slowness differences, which are supported by the DCS, Stavanger Page 8, Revision March 2003Jotun 25/8-B-29 Shear anisotropy processing and interpretation dispersion curves. Here, the QC indicators are suggestive of genuine TI anisotropy: minimum cross energy is low, difference between max and min energies is present, fast shear azimuth is stable and anisotropy is seen on the waveforms. The fast shear angle is essentially horizontal; consistent with the bedding. The sand in the interval 3057-3067m shows small energy anisotropy and very low slowness anisotropy. Based on the frequency-domain processing (dispersion plots in Figure-8), the anisotropy is intrinsic. No stress related effects are observed. The sands in Figure 9&10 (3165-3200m), are isotropic as identified by characteristic log responses: All anisotropy indicators in this interval show that the anisotropy is not significant. The fast-shear azimuth uncertainty is large and the waveforms in track five exhibit no time lag between the fast and slow arrivals. The waveforms are also observed to be nearly identical. As discussed above, the fast-shear azimuth has no significance, since the slowness is the same in all directions. The apparent angle seems to be very close to the tool azimuth (i.e., it follows the tool rotation; no rotation in this case).

TIH anisotropy is present when vertical open fractures are present and/or in presence of horizontal stress anisotropy (Sh << SH). TIH is best recorded by DSI-BCR in vertical well, as it is insensitive to TIV. TIH can be detected in deviated well, but interpretation will be subject to caution, as DSI-BCR may respond to TIV as well. DCS, Stavanger Page 26, Revision March 2003TIV stands for Transverse Isotropy Vertical axis. TIV anisotropy is associated with laminations. It is almost always present in shales but not in clean sandstone and carbonate. TIV is best recorded by DSI-BCR in horizontal well, as it is insensitive to TIH. TIV can be detected in deviated well, but interpretation will be subject to caution, as DSI-BCR may respond to TIH as well. DCS, Stavanger Page 27, Revision March 2003
