Exception BOR GFA F-01 00007 from OD-veiledning til regelverk, til 23 - krav til barrierer. According to this, one of the barriers while drilling is normally homogenous mud column in hydrostatic overbalance to the pore pressure. When drilling 1/2 hole through the bottom of the Shetland Group, the mud weight will only be in dynamic overbalance to the pore pressure. 2.2 Exceptions from KP-10 1. Exception BOR GFA F-01 00007 from KP1O-K240, 4.1.3 - Fluid barriers. According to this, the fluid density shall always exercise an overbalance relative to the pore pressure. will only be in dynamic overbalance to the pore pressure. This means that the mud weight will not be barrier when the mud pumps are off. 2.3 Exceptions from Main Drilling Programme None. 2.4 Exceptions from 'Boreanbefaling' (RTD) 1. Exception from 'Boreanbefaling for boremal IARI12', M-GF-0000160: A separate exception document (TO-RESU-HF-GF-01 00003) has been written, which states what has been changed since the RTD-document was written and up until now. See appendix 2. Exception from 'Boreanbefaling for boremal IARI12', M-GF-0000160, chapter 4.1: Target has the UTMN coordinate 6782900, and the depth 1807 TVD MSL.. Target has been moved 150 to the north, thus the UTM coordinate will be 6783050, the corresponding depth will be 1775 TVD MSL. Done to make absolutely certain of entering the reservoir at least 100 north of where doing so in A-41A. Page 10 of 1393. Exception from 'Boreanbefaling for borem51 IARI12', M-GF-0000160, chapter 4.6: TD is approximately 100 past target 2. TD for the well will be approx. 40 past target (10 available below target to correlate the perforation guns + 30 shoetrack and rathole), seeking to minimize the length drilled in the Drake Formation. Page 11 of 139STATO 3 Health, Safety, Environment and Quality (HSE & Q) 3.1 HSE  Keep focus on avoiding falling objects. Perform frequent derrick inspections, and report on DBR. All efforts must be made to minimize the time and personnel in the rig derrick. Ensure that ALL tools and equipment carried up in the derrick are secured and registered in the log book.  Well control. There is potential for high pressures in both the Lista Formation, in the Shetland Group and in the reservoir, ref. chapter 3.3.5.  Precautions due to usage of oil based mud. Experiences from A-47 shows that everyone must be quick to change clothes/coveralls if they get oil based mud on them. If it takes too long to get out of wet/dirty coveralls, one might experience rashes or even more severe damages. 3.2 Quality For this well, special quality focus points will be:  Ensure contractor personnel are dedicated for GFA as per contract.  QC inspection and certification of all equipment.  Keep focus on improving the pipe handling efficiency. 3.2.1 QRS Performance Rating Sheet (PRS): As of 01.01.2001, all activities has difficulty factor 1.0. 3.2.2 Logistics The following instructions shall be adhered to with regards to delivery of goods and materials to Statoil Gullfaks operation:  Delivery tickets shall be provided by e-mail to 'Fellespostkasse ANS email@removed.com'.  Delivery of material shall take place no later than 11:00 in order to be shipped out to the offshore installation the same day. Deliveries which arrive later than 11:00 will be shipped out on next available vessel, unless otherwise agreed with Statoil Material Coordinator.  All equipment shall be delivered in accordance to Statoil's check list, or contractor's own if Statoil's demands are fullfilled..  Statoils Material Coordinator shall also be notified in case of part deliveries. Page 12 of 139 Contractor is responsible for transportation and follow-up of all equipment including third party equipment which is delivered under the relevant contracts.  Furthermore it is contractor's responsibility to arrange for and call out personnel for any operation. The personnel planning shall be done based on approval and input from Statoil operation office at Sandsli.  Contractor's personnel onboard Gullfaks are responsible for packing their own equipment and make it ready for backload. Remaining equipment onboard shall be inventoried and reported to Statoil drilling supervisor. 3.3 Risk analysis  Risk analysis have been performed for the slot recovery operation, the whipstock/ milling operation, the 12 1/4 section, the 1/2 section, the section and for the completion of the well. Potensial problems have been adressed and risk reducing actions have been identified and included in the program. The results from these sessions will be presented and thoroughly gone through at respective section meetings. Flowcharts will be made for operations with high risk factors. 3.3.1 Potential for well interference Interference wells Depth in Well [mMD] Centre/centre distance (A) [m] Statoil Closing Factor (C=A/B) Min. Allowed Distance (B) A-41 563 2653.5 , The closest distance to A-36 is at MD, while we will be more than 100 m away from A-41A at all times (below A-41A KOP at 3040 MD, 1731 TVD). Ref Clearance reports, section 7.4. These figures are based on RIGS run in 13 3/8 casing to 2563 (kick off point) and MWD (MWD mon in error model) to TD. Page 13 of 1393.3.2 Stuck pipe To avoid the potential for stuck pipe situations, it is necessary to focus on continuously good communication between drilling supervisor/drilling engineer/operations geologist, tool pusher, driller, directional driller, MWD engineer, mud logger, mud engineer and the MPA operator. Proper handovers at shift hours are very important. Please beware: Lack of communication and discussion prior to decisions and operations is often fatal. Prior to start and during drilling A-41B, stuck pipe video campaign will be held offshore. Critical operations in well A-41B with respect to stuck pipe:  If one has to mill some of the 5/8 tie-backstring, in order to eliminate it down to 2600 MD, steel swarf left in the well could cause stuck pipe situation. It is of uttermost importance to clean the well properly for steel swarf after eventual milling.  Running in and out of the window: Do not rotate when the BHA is in, or close to, the window. Do not pump, either, when the bit is passing through the window, as this makes the bit rotate. This applies for the whole 12 1/4 section, for every trip.  Drilling 12 1/4 section: The section length is 1000 and the maximum inclination is 76.5. Proper hole cleaning must be focused at all times to prevent stuck pipe situations. Dog legs as high as 3,0/30 means that steering intervals will be long, so one has to ensure that the hole is properly cleaned before each connection, the same implies for the 1/2 section.  Possible back reaming in open hole: If there are large amounts of cuttings in the annulus, pulling out of the hole too fast can lead to packing off the hole. Pressure data from the MWD tool must be used for surveillance of the hole conditions during back reaming. Keep control of the TVD depth in order to get correct ECD-values. Again, good communication is vital.  Drilling/ logging of hole: The open hole reservoir section to be drilled and logged is 210 long and has an angle of 70.8. The operations must be planned to avoid stuck pipe problems due to differential sticking. The well will be underbalanced in the impermeable shales of Drake Formation (last 40 meters of the section), meaning that the drill string, logging string and the liner could get stuck due to hole collapse. Page 14 of 1393.3.3 H2S H2S is not expected. However, if drilling into water phase, there might be H2S as result of water injection. It was observed 30 ppm in A-36 when testing in February 2000 (ref. 'Boreanbefaling for boremal IARI12', M-GF-0000160, chapter 5.1). 3.3.4 Kick tolerance All kick tolerances are within the required margins stated in the Casing Design Manual. Hole section [1] Min. kick tolerance Calculated kick tolerance (Kickcak) [m3] 12 1/4 8 1/2 Infinite 6 Infinite Page 15 of 1393.3.5 Potential drilling problems Special focus points during slot recovery, window milling and drilling are:  Damaging the 13 3/8 casing when cutting the 5/8 tie-back string The 13 3/8 casing was weakened during drilling of 34/10-A-41, particularly when, while drilling 12 1/4 section, one backreamed out to wellhead. Misplaced and/or badly performed cuts, and eventual milling, could increase the casing wear to such an extent that it can no longer be used as part of A-41B. If this happens, one must then also remove the 13 3/8 casing down to below 20 shoe, and drill new sidetrack from there. Risk reducing actions - Perform cut(s) maximum above connections. - The cutting assembly will be centralized inside the 5/8 tie-back string. - The knives have designed maximum OD, based on pressure drop after cutting through 5/8 tie-back string.  Not being able to pass 2400 MD (1500 TVD) with the whipstock The kick off point in the 13 3/8 casing has been chosen with care. We have to be able to drill the 12 1/4 section to TD, even if it turns out that the pore pressure in top of the Shetland Group is SG. If the whipstock can not pass 2400 MD, it means that one either has to remove the 13 3/8 casing down to below 20 shoe, and drill new sidetrack from there, or take the risk that the pore pressure in top of the Shetland Group is no higher than SG (estimated as maximum pressure seen in the well 34/10-A-41A). - Perform clean out run, prior to run the bridge plug, with an assembly, with fullgauge mill, as stiff as the whipstockassembly.  Milling through centralizer It will normally be hard to tell if one is milling through centralizer, although there might be indications like reduced progress. - Consider extra clean out runs if suspecting that centralizer causes obstructions in the well path. - Use the copy of the old tally which is included in the program, ref. appendix 8.1.6. - Will not mill out through the top of joint, ensuring this by setting the whipstock base (bridge plug) just above connection, ref. appendix 8.1.8. Page 16 of 139Drilling Programme 34/10-A-41B Gullfaks 0 STATOIL Rev.nr.: Dato: 14.05.01  Drilling into fracture in the Lista-Fm, the Shetland Group or the reservoir filled with SG mud While drilling and killing A-41A, fractures were induced in the well and filled with 1.94 SG mud. The location and reach of these fractures are not clear, but it is believed that there could be one in the Lista-Fm, there could also be one in the upper half of the Shetland Group and there could, as well, be one in the bottom of the Shetland Group or even in the reservoir (ref. 'Risikovurdering 34/10-A-41A, nytt sidesteg',GF-B&B-0000004). Drilling into such fracture would cause kick, and maybe even an abandonment of the well. - The well path has been carefully designed to minimize the risk of drilling into any such fractures. - Procedures for handling high pressures will be established.  High pore pressure when drilling 12 1/4 and 1/2 section in the Shetland Group The max pore pressure gradient in the Shetland Group for this well is probably SG, but there is possibility of the pressure being as high as SG. - The depth of the decided kick off point in the 13 3/8 csg, is chosen so that the formation has the strength that is necessary to be able to drill to TD of the section with SG mud weigth.  High angle and turn in the 12 1/4 section, problems with steering and stuck pipe At the start of the section the inclination is built from 67 to 76 while the direction changes from 89 to 75, resulting in 3.0/ 30 dogleg. Then 650 long tangent section is planned. At the end of the section there is planned drop to 72 angle while the direction is changed to 94, giving 3.0/30 dogleg for the lower part of the section. - Proper hole cleaning is important to avoid stuck pipe during drilling of this section. Torque vs. depth plots, pressure sub readings and surveillance of other drilling parameters must be continuously evaluated. The active volume method will be used to keep track of the hole cleaning. - Prior to drilling this section, meeting to discuss all potential problems and risks will be arranged. The minutes of this meeting will be distributed. Page 17 of 139STATOIL Dokumentnr.: GFRESUHF U-01 00032  High angle and turn in the 1/2 section, problems with steering and stuck pipe At the start of the section the inclination is dropped from 72 to 70 while direction changes from 94 to 108, resulting in 3.0/ 30 dogleg. The last 20 is tangent section. - Torque vs. depth plots, pressure sub readings and other drilling parameters must be continuously evaluated. The active volume method will be used.  Losing circulation when drilling into the reservoir The prognosed pore pressure in bottom of the Shetland Group is SG, while the fracture gradient in top of the reservoir is prognosed to be SG. With an ECD- contribution estimated to 0.08-0.10 SG, one will most likely lose the circulation, if drilling into the reservoir with MW in hydrostatic overbalance to the pore pressure. - The 1/2 section will be drilled with MW at SG (meaning that we only have dynamic overbalance). The MW has been chosen with care, assuring that it is above the collapse pressure gradient. - To reduce ECD-contributions: - The hole will be circulated clean every 50 meters drilled in the 1/2 section. - Prior to drilling into the reservoir, the mud pump rate will be reduced to the lowest possible (depending on the specifications for the MWD-tool). - Drill with ROP to not overload the hole with cuttings. - Show extreme care when turning pumps on/off. - Detailed procedures/guidelines for drilling into the reservoir will be made. Page 18 of 139 Low formation strength in the reservoir and initial pore pressure in the Drake-Fm The Brent reservoir is probably depleted. We will therefore drill the formation with MW at SG, the fracture gradient is calculated to be SG (though it could be as low as SG). The Drake Formation is probably not depleted, as it is imper- meable claystone and shale, the most likely pore pressure is SG. Hence, 17 bars of underbalance is expected. This potential underbalance could give us wellbore instability problems, especially when running 1/2 liner. Kick should not be potential problem, as the Drake-Fm is impermeable. - Top of Drake Formation will be verified with drill break. - The Drake Formation will be drilled on wiper trip after the logging operation. - Will minimize the length drilled into the Drake-Fm. Thus, the area exposed of the Drake-Fm and the time of exposure, will be kept at minimum. - Will check hole condition after every 10 drilled. - The 1/2 liner will be supplied with reamer shoe. Page 19 of 1394 Drilling 4.1 General drilling Best Practice Documents in Drilling and Well Technology are found on Statoil Extranet. The well could become very challenging, due to several potential major problems. Everyone involved must read chapter 3.3.2 and 3.3.5 thoroughly, in order to get good understanding of these potential problems. 4.1.1 Drilling fluids Ref. table in Appendix 8.6. 4.2 Preparation There is bridge plug @ 2930 MD, the TSR is closed and there is put pressure of 14 bar on the well. The fluid in the well is waterbased mud with density of SG ( ref. appendix 8.1.11) The well test pressure has been verified to 70 bar, after setting the bridge plug. All annular pressures are known, and the medium in every annulus are checked for H2S, hydrocarbons, mud or water (ref. to table below). This should also be done maximum week prior to the operation.

EZSV Plug g: 2930 EZSV Plug tested to: 70 bar, SG mud Cement: none Tubing: production tubing is pulled TSR: ID: 9.75. TSR Wear bushing ID: Mud: WBM, MW = SG 4.3 Removal of 10 3/4 5/8 tie-back string The slot recovery operation consists of removing 2600 meters of 10 3/4 5/8 tie-back string. This will primarily be done by cutting and pulling, but the last meters could be milled out if cut and pull shows slow progress (less than approx. 30 m/day). 4.3.1 Operational guidelines 1. Run in hole with an 1/2 BHA on DP to displace the well to SG WBM. POOH. 2. Perform tension test w/spear assy (BHA #1a), then RIH w/cut assy (BHA #1b) to depth dictated by tension test result. 3. Remove 2600 tie-back string, follow the sequence in the flow chart, ref. appendix 8.1.1.  Do not perform more than two cuts with the same cutters.  If cutting and pulling in small pieces, use combined cut&pull assembly to reduce the number of runs.  Only include float in the string when there is no packoff.  Perform pressure tests after some of the cuts, to check if the 13 3/8 casing has been severely damaged.  Prior to eventual milling: Perform pressure test on the system. Displace the well to mud optimized for this operation. Perform cleanup run inside the 13 3/8 casing (assembly should be as in 4.4.1. pt. 1).  If milling has to be done: POOH to change mill assembly after approximately every 25 hours of milling.  After an eventual milling operation: Open the BOP and clean it thoroughly, also make sure that the well is free for steel swarf. 4. Test the well to 100 bar. Page 21 of 1394.4 Setting of whipstock/window milling in 13 3/8 casing. The kick-off will be in 13 3/8 casing at approximately 2563 MD/ 1555 TVD using whipstock (top window planned at m, bottom window planned at m). 4.4.1 Operational guidelines 1. Run in hole with separate scrape assembly, BHA #1c. The assembly should be rigid, with junk trapper and preferably with mill. Scrape setting area for whipstock and EZSV plug. POOH to 2510 m, scrape setting area for 5/8 liner hanger. POOH. 2. Run in hole and set 13 3/8 EZSV plug on DP, with top of plug at InMD. Exact setting depth will be worked out in cooperation with the whipstock operator.  Avoid milling through tooljoints, keep this in mind when deciding plug depth. 3. Displace well to SG OBM. POOH. 4. Run RTTS to 700 m. 5. Pressure test above RTTS to 310 bar/10 min and below RTTS to 225 bar. Pull RTTS. 6. Run whipstock in hole with MWD, BHA #1d. Orient to 60 left of high side and set at approx. 2562 mIVID. Mill window according to whipstock operators procedures, ref. appendix 8.1.10.  There is two centralizers pr joint on the 13 3/8 casing, placement impossible to verify, ref. appendix 8.5. 7. Mill until the spacer water melon mill is out of the window, approx. into the formation, total milling length being approx. m.  If the directional driller requests larger rathole, one can mill further. 8. Perform an FIT to SG (estimated fracture pressure:1.88 SG). The FIT should be taken with the cement pumps in order to supervise the volume pumped and bled back. If the FIT is lower than SG, then squeeze cementing of the window should be considered, ref. decision tree appendix 8.11.1. 9. Consider pumping high weight pill at TD for the milling section. 10. POOH, check gauges on mills. Perform backup run, BHA #1e, if necessary. Page 22 of 1394.4.2 Contingency squeeze cementing Ref. table appendix 8.7. Purpose of the cement job Squeeze cement the 13 3/8 window to obtain the required FIT of SG. Key factors on the job The cement slurry design could change based on what is seen during milling of the window and during the FIT. In any cases fluid loss control is required to avoid the cement slurry from bridging off too early. There should be enough chemicals on the rig to mix 20 tn3 of the proposed cement slurry design. The squeeze should be performed by spotting cement plug across the window, pulling the pipe above TOC and apply squeeze pressure. Hesitation squeezing could be beneficial if required squeeze pressure has not been met when half the cement slurry volume is squeezed away. It is necessary to reduce the amount of cement left in the casing to minimum. Depending on density and condition of the fluid behind the casing, high density pill should be spotted as base for the cement plug prior to POOH with the milling assembly. In case the cement squeeze will be performed, job outlines will be sent to the rig together with the recommended cement slurry design. Page 23 of 1394.5 Drilling 12 1/4 hole section The 12 1/4 hole is planned to be drilled from 13 3/8 casing window to TD, @ 1810 TVD RKB (in the latter part of the Shetland group). See section table. The objective of the section is to drill and isolate the Hordaland and Rogaland Formations and top half of the Shetland Group, so that one can reduce the MW prior to drilling into the reservoir. Section table Section Length 1007 MD (255 TVD) Inclination Build from 67.3 to 76.5, drop from to 72.4 Azimuth Change from 89.4 to 75.2, and then from 75.2 to 94.9 4.5.1 Operational guidelines 1. Drill 12 1/4 hole to TD at approximately 3570 MD / 1810 TVD  The well changes name, for all reporting matters, from 34/10-A41 to 34/10-A-41B when one starts drilling new formation with 12 1/4 BHA..  See Chapter - for proposal listing and well profile.  Use the active volume method to keep track of the hole cleaning.  Increase mud weight, in steps, to SG, while drilling the Lista Formation.  Measure up/ down weight and torque at several depths (TD, 13 3/8 window).  Avoid rotating whenever the BHA is in, or close to, the window. Do not pump, either, when the bit is passing through the window.  Drilling into mud filled fracture, which is very unlikely, will lead to kick. The consequences and immediate actions are depending on where we eventually expe- rience this, ref. appendix 8.11.2. Detailed procedures for handling high pressures will be distributed along with section recommendations.  It is possible that the pore pressure in the top of the Shetland Group, is as high as 1.76 SG. Production will then be shut down, while the mud weight is increased and until well control is reestablished. The section will then be drilled to planned TD, watch the ECD! 2. Circulate hole clean, minimum BU, with max flow rate and max RPM. POOH.  Back reaming shall only be performed if it is not possible to clean the hole by circulating at bottom, or if other conditions dictates it. 3. Run 5/8 liner to 3569 MD. Set hanger according to Nodeco procedure, try to set the hanger with rotation. See chapter 4.5.7. for further details. 4. Cement 5/8 liner, rotate if possible with 20-30 rpm, ref. chapter 4.5.8. 5. Set the integrated TSP packer with rotation, according to Nodeco's procedures. Pressure test TSP packer to 210 bar/ minutes. 6. POOH with landing string. 7. L/D 12 1/4 BHA, consider to cut and slip drilline, and make up 1/2 BHA. Page 24 of 139Drilling Programme 34/10-A-416 Gullfaks Rev.nr.: Dato: 14.05.01 8. RIH to 1250 while PU DP. RIH on 5/8 DP to TOC. Reduce MW to SG while RIH. 9. Drill out shoetrack and rathole. There is no need for an FIT, because of the use of higher MW in the 12 1/4 section than the ECD values the formation will experience in the 1/2 section (if the mud weight is SG). 4.5.2 Directional drilling 4.5.2.1 Directional plan Ref.

This MWD uses the mon error model, the azimuth measurement could, for the first 100 meters, be influenced by magnetic interference from A-41. Inclination and toolface are not influenced. No gyro is planned. To avoid magnetic interference in the MWD from the dtillstring, two nonmags has to be placed between the MWD directional sensor and the magnetic components above. The distance from the directional sensor and down to the motor should be at least 15 m. Page 26 of 139The section is planned with an azimuth of 75-94 and with an inclination of 67 - 75.

Landing string A 5/8 DP landing string gives 32 ton set down weight without helical buckling (according to simulations, sinus buckling occurs at 23 ton). The TSP can be set with or without rotation (30 RPM), the limits are 28 and 23 ton before respectively sinus and helical buckling occurs if one does not rotate the string.

Place cement in the entire annulus up to 200 MD above top of the Shetland Group.  All pumps are checked out prior to the cement job, and the pump efficiency is measured and known.  Gas tight cement slurry shall be used.  Measure the casing ID of every 5th joint. If deviations, calculate the capacity to obtain a correct displacement volume.  If the top plug most certainly has been released, use up to 2% lower volumetric pump efficiency than the lowest pump efficiency observed.  If air in the pumps and the top plug most certainly has been released, pump until the plug bumps.  Pump rate when bumping the plug: 1000 LPM.  Excess mixing fluid must be re-injected through the SMACCC system. Compositions and volumes must be recorded continuously (after each job) in ESOP. A detailed cement procedure with final simulations included will be sent to the rig prior to the cement job. 4.5.9 Sampling Ref. Chapter 6.2.1 Cuttings and mud sampling. Page 28 of 1394.6 Drilling 1/2 hole section The 1/2 hole is planned to be drilled from 5/8 shoe to TD, as short as possible into the reservoir. See section table. TD criteria is to verify top reservoir, either with drill break or by cuttings. Top reservoir (Base Cretaceous/Rannoch Fm) is prognosed to be at MD/1857.2 m TVD RKB, ref. chapter 6.1.6. The objective of the section is to drill and isolate the bottom half of the Shetland Group, so that one is able to reduce the mud weight prior to drilling the reservoir. Section Length 150 MD (47 TVD) Inclination Drop from 72.4 to 70,8 Azimuth Change from 94.9 to 108.4 4.6.1 Operational guidelines 1. Drill 1/2 hole to TD at approximately 3719 MD / 1857 TVD (as short as possible into the reservoir).  Circulate the hole clean after every 50 meters drilled.  Drill with limited ROP to avoid overloading the hole with cuttings.  Measure up/ down weight and torque at several depths (TD, 5/8 shoe).  Write cavings log.  Pay special attention to the ECD-value, especially from 3670 (1840 TVD) to TD. It must never exceed SG. Be extra careful when turning on and off pumps.  There is possibility of losses when drilling into the reservoir, LCM-materials and Flex plug (or equivalent) must be prepared prior to this. Cure eventual losses.  If kick is experienced when entering the reservoir, the well will be cemented back. A detailed procedure for drilling into the reservoir will be distributed along with section recommendations. 2.

Landing string A landing string consisting of 3/4 DC inside the liner, with stand of 3/4 DC above liner hanger, DP inside 5/8 liner, and 1/2 DP to surface gives 24 ton set down weight without helical buckling (according to simulations, sinus buckling occurs at 19 ton). The TSP must be set with rotation (30 RPM), the limits are 17 and 13 ton before respectively helical and sinus buckling occurs, if one does not rotate the string. The liner will be supplied with reamer shoe. Note: An alternative solution is to set the 1/2 liner in the 5/8 liner (the 1/2 liner overlaps the liner), this will be decided upon closer to operation start. The landing string will in this case consist of DP inside the 5/8 liner and 5/8 DP to surface. Calculations will be made for this alternative, if it is chosen.

Place cement in the entire annulus up to top of liner lap, to ensure zonal isolation.  All pumps are checked out, and the pump efficiency is measured and known, prior to the cement job.  Gas tight cement slurry shall be used.  Measure the casing ID of every 5th joint. If deviations, calculate the capacity to obtain a correct displacement volume.  If the top plug most certainly has been released, use up to 2% lower volumetric pump efficiency than the lowest pump efficiency observed.  If air in the pumps and the top plug most certainly has been released, pump until the plug bumps.  Excess mixing fluid must be re-injected through the SMACCC system. Compositions and volumes must be recorded continuously (after each job) in ESOP. A detailed cement procedure with final simulations included will be sent to the rig prior to the cement job. 4.7.9 Sampling Ref. Chapter 6.2.1 Cuttings and mud sampling. 4.7.10 Electrical logging 1 logging run is planned, if the planned configuration allows it. Ref. Section 6.2.5. The logging string configuration will be further evaluated closer to start of the operation.

When arriving on location, the equipment shall be inspected by the supplier and Statoil representative. 2. Before installing the tubing, all components must be inspected, drifted and measured. 3. All pressure testing of equipment shall be witnessed by Statoil representative and documented. copy of all pressure charts must be kept in the well file. 4. Hand over documentation for all equipment installed in the well shall be completed and delivered to the production department according to Operational acceptance certificates checklists. 5. All tubing equipment must be drifted (from land) using special drift (6.125/155.6 mm). Offshore need to verify that drifting of tubing has been carried out. Page 41 of 1395.6 Cleaning of Well 5.6.1 Objective Displace OBM to sea-water. Inflow test the well. Clean the well until NTU reading is below 100, or levels off. Displace to packer fluid. 5.6.2 Safety  Perform pre-job meeting with all involved personnel prior to operation.  Monitor trip tank when RIH & POOH.  Ensure that sufficient materials is kept on the rig to mix/pump amount of mud if the inflow test is negative.  Mud logger is to monitor returns for gas and keep volume control.  At least two hole volumes of packer fluid shall be available on the rig when starting the operation. 5.6.3 Technical With reference to BJ cleaning procedures, ensure that relevant pits, mud pumps and surface equipment are clean. Flush with wash pills if possible. Relevant circulating lines and equipment must be completely clean of mud prior to initiating cleaning programme as follows:  All tanks, lines and pumps involved in the cleanup operation should be thoroughly cleaned before starting the well clean up.  All fluid compositions are given in Table 5.2, Fluid compositions.  Top of 1/2 liner planned at 3668 m. Top of liner planned at 3519 m. 4 1/2 liner shoe-track planned at 3899 m. Completion fluid volumes (depths) to be confirmed when well has been drilled and liners set.  Break circulation every 1000 on way in to break gel strength of mud.  Ensure that mud properties and pump pressures are stable before displacing to sea water. Mud properties in = Mud properties out, and stable pump pressure.  Observe returns over shakers and report amount of foreign material in mud.  The MFCT allows the string below to be stationary when it has been sheared and down-weight is applied. This means no reciprocation while pumping after MFCT has been sheared. Ref. SPS-Afos procedures. MFCT is pinned to 20,000 lbs.  Do not dump returns of soap and packer-fluid/brine. Take return in pits. All fluids to be injected or sent onshore for destruction or filtering.  Two pits must be clean and ready for mixing packer fluid (composition 6) Page 42 of 139Rev.nr.: Dato: 14.05.01  The packer fluid properties, i.e. density, cleanliness, pH, 02.content and NTU shall be verified prior to pumping into well.  BJ is to plot turbidity (NTU) reading to monitor when NTU readings level off. The density and cleanliness of the packer-fluid pumped in and return shall be checked. Take return to pits.  Ensure that all drill pipe and drill collars to be run in later operations are used in wash string.  Minimize the use of dope using small paint brush. Dope pin end only. Wipe off all excess dope squeezed out through the connections.  Clean packer area w/ 5/8 scraper.  Clean PBR area w/ PBR mill. Apply Bakerlock on PBR mill to verify entering of PBR.  Circulate at least hole-volumes of mud at max pump rate, and condition the mud while rotating and slowly reciprocating string (30 RPM / 20m stroke). Keep circulating until mud properties and pump pressures are stable.  NB! Do not open and close MFCT while pumping. Stop pump before opening or closing MFCT.  NB! Do not confuse Oil Based Mud with Oil Based Soap!

The injection support is critical to produce the remaining reserves from the Lower Brent Group. The well will be completed as WAG injector in the Lower Brent Group in segment Il. 6.1.2 Secondary objective None 6.1.3 Well location The well will be located south in segment Ii (see fig.6.2 and 6.3), in secure distance from the main fault bounding the segment to the west, and dipping to the east - northeast to cut the lithologies in the Lower Brent Group (see figures and 6.4-6.7). The wellpath is also designed to keep clear of the overpressured fissures generated by well A-41A. Target is located 150 north of target in well A-41A. The well is located in the southeastern part of the Gullfaks Field. The drop of the Base Cretaceous unconfornuty towards south and east gives clear limitation in this direction. The reservoir pressure should be lower than 290 bars ref. 1850 TVD MSL for the well to meet its primary objective, this is not considered to be problem, as all available data from well A-41A indicate reservoir pressure lower than this in that location. In case of higher reservoir pressure, sidetrack further to the east in the segment will be considered. 6.1.4 Fallback location The well has potential as producer in the Cook Formation in segment Ii, south of A-40 (PCCI12). Page 55 of 1396.1.5 Reservoir considerations The well 34/10-A-41B is proposed drilled based on the following points:  Well A-41 does not give sufficient pressure support to the producers in segment Il. Reservoir pressures far above initial, are measured in the well. This indicates that the injection water is trapped close to the injector instead of migrating out towards the producers. This results in pressure buildup close to the well, also indicated on 4-D seismic.  The most likely reason for the lack of pressure support from A-41 is that the well is drilled in an area dominated by deformation bands, caused by the short distance (60 - 75 m) to the main fault separating the H- and the I- segments. Deformation bands, generated in sandstone lithologies can lead to reduction in permeability of several orders. Zones of deformation bands may therefore lead to severe pressure barriers in production time.  Deformation bands are associated with faults, as they are generated as an early stadium of the generation of faults. This means that moving further away from the fault also leads to moving away from the zone of deformation bands.  The estimated effect on oil production by the injector is estimated to be Msm3, assuming that new production well is drilled right after A-41B to help the existing ones.

Page 67 of 139Drilling Programme 34/10-A-41B Gullfaks Dokumentnr.: GFRESUHF U-01 00032 6.3 Pressure prognosis 6.3.1 Pore pressure 6.3.1.1 Pore pressure above the reservoir The pore pressure development in the top hole section is given in figure 6.8, pressure prognosis-gradients. The curve is based on data from offset wells and maps of the pore pressure distribution across the Cretaceous. Being very close to A-41, main emphasis is put on data from this well. The pore pressure is assumed to be hydrostatic down to the top of the early Eocene part of the Hordaland Group, 1362 TVD RKB. At this depth the hydrostatic pore pressure corresponds to 0,97 g/cm3 equivalent mud weight. The pressure buildup zone starts where the sand content of the Hordaland Group decreases, at the top of the early Eocene part, 1362 TVD RKB. At the same depth presence of limestone and calcite cemented zones increase. The pore pressure seems to increase in steps when drilling through limestone and carbonate cemented layers. The thickness and abrasiveness of the stringers and cemented zones vary. There seems to be larger increase in pore pressure and drilled formation gas underneath the thick hard stringers and cemented zones than underneath the thinner and softer ones. The pore pressure increases rapidly through the rest of the Hordaland Group, the Balder Formation and the Lista Formation. The pore pressure is expected to be 1,36 g/cm3EMW at top of the Balder Formation, 1,44 g/cm3 at top of the Lista Formation and 1,63 g/cm3 at top of the Shetland Group. In case of normal pressure development in the Shetland Group, the pore pressure is expected to reach its highest level at approximately 30 TVD above the Base Cretaceous, expected to equal g/cm3 EMW. At Base Cretaceous, the pore pressure is expected to equal g/cm3. In case of abnormally high pore pressures in the Shetland Group, pore pressures up to &In' can be expected. The pore pressure underneath the top of the Shetland Group at the Gullfaks field has been topic of discussion in light of the latter wells drilled from GFB and GFC. In the wells B-4A, B-39/39T2/39A/39AT2, B-40, C-42T2 and C-39 unusually high gas readings and influx of fluids in the well bore have been encountered when drilling into the Shetland Group. This is believed to be related to an abnormally high pore pressure in the top of the Shetland Group. The problem has occured after the drilling of some 150 wells at the Gullfaks field without problems. Page 68 of 139A project group constituted in the summer of 1999 has stated in their report (LUT GEO POG-B000015R) that the abnormal high pore pressure in the Shetland Group in these wells is the result of recent incidents. The most plausible theories are based on the concept of high pressure injection in the reservoir segments, and pressure/fluid migration into the cap rock along reactivated fault zones, fractures induced by high injection pressures or along the void space behind poorly cemented casings. The hard impermeable limestone layer at the top of the Shetland Group seems to have acted as trap for these gases and fluids, allowing them to accumulate in fractures generated in the Shetland Group shale and permeable zones along the shale/limestone interface. A 4D seismic survey, taken in 1999, shows locally distinct amplitude changes at top Cretaceous level between data gathered in 1996 and in 1999. These amplitude changes are interpreted as being related to accumulation of hydrocarbons in the sediments at top Cretaceous level in the time span between 1996 og 1999. The extention of areas with abnormal amplitudes coincide with some of the areas where high pore pressures at the top of the Shetland Group have been encountered in wells. These are the areas between the GFB- and GFC-platforms, where the base Cretaceous unconformity is at its shallowest level. Experiences from C-39 show that the prediction of abnormal pressures in the Shetland Group can not be done based solely on interpretation of 4D seismic surveys or observations of offset wells. A-41B is to be drilled as second sidetrack from A-41 as result of the problems with the first sidetrack, A-41A. The overinjection in A-41, creating reservoir pressure far above the initial reservoir pressure in the area close to the wellbore, has been evaluated as possible reason for the supercharging of the Shetland Group. After drilling of the Shetland Group in well A-41A, the maximum porepressure was evaluated to be less than 1,70 g/cm3 (Ref. Risikovurdering 34/10-A-41A, nytt sidesteg). However, the 1/2 section in A-41A was drilled with 1,76 g/cm3 mud, and with high ECD, so abnormal high pressures below the two uppermost limestone beds in the Shetland Group (up to 1,76 g/cm3) can not be excluded. If drilling through overpressured fractures in the Lista Formation or the Shetland Group generated by well A-41A, the well may be exposed to pressures equal to the fracture propagation pressure of 1,94 g/cm3. The wellpath is, however, designed to avoid these fractures. Page 69 of 1396.3.1.2 Pore pressure in the reservoir onnation/ group Reservoir pressure bar Uncertainty Lower Brent Group Ii 260 +30/-20 Dependent on earlier water injection in A-41 and the amount of waterflow out from the area around A-41. Reservoir pressures are referred to datum depth 1850 TVD MSL. Expected formation pressure in equivalent mud weight are presented in figure 6.8. Background for the prognosis: The pore pressure prognosis in the Lower Brent Group in segment Ii is based on data from the pressure gauge in well A-40, well tests in A-36, measured wellhead pressures in A-41, and observed changes in 4D seismic. The pressure data measured in A-40, with permanent pressure gauge (after 10 days shut MSL). And pressures measured in A-40 with permanent pressure gauge (after 57 days shut in period, 18.01.01: 241 bar ref. 1850 TVD MSL). The pressure data measured in A-41 in the well head (21.03.00 : 361 bar ref. 1850 TVD A-41 has been closed in since 03.00, and the pressure close to the well decreases with time. There is pressure gradient from south towards the north. A-41 is situated in the southernmost part in zone of deformation bands, and has got the highest reservoir pressure. When A-41A was drilled in 10.00. some 200 north of A-41, the reservoir pressure was evaluated to be equal to, or less than, 270 bar ref. 1850 TVD MSL. A-40 is situated 1000 north of well A-41B. Pressure development: Neither injection nor production is taking place in the segment, but the water accumulated close to A-41 is believed still to move slowly northwards. Hence, the pressure gradient in the segment is considered to decrease with time, and the pressure in the northern part of the segment is considered to be increasing with time. The pressure prognosis is dependent on the conditions that the well hits Ti and T2 within the given tolerances, that is outside the pressure buildup zone around A-41 and outside the zone of deformation bands probably assosiated with the main fault. An updated pore pressure prognosis will be distributed along with section meeting notes. Page 70 of 1396.3.2 Fracture gradients 6.3.2.1 Fracture gradients above the reservoir The fracture gradient above the reservoir is derived on the basis of formation integrity/strenght tests from nearby wells, due to the close distance to A-41, main emphasis is put on this well. 6.3.2.2 Fracture gradients in the reservoir The fracture gradient in the reservoir is calculated based on the latest evaluations of Mini-Frac tests in selected wells on the Gullfaks Field (Ref: GRO930069N). correlation between reduction of pore pressure due to production and reduction of fracture gradient is assumed. Minimum stress is calculated as initial fracture pressure compensated for pressure depletion. The assumed tensile strenght of the formation is added to give an estimate of the current fracture pressure. The fracture gradients are shown in fig. 6.8. 6.3.3 H2S evaluation In case water phase in the reservoir is penetrated, H2S can occur as result of water injection. 30 ppm was observed in A-36 in test in febniary 2000. 6.3.4 Potential problems  The possibility of presence of overpressure in the upper part of the Shetland Group, as described in the report Hoye trykk kritt og paleocen pa Gullfaks hovedfelt (LUT GEO POG-B000015R).  The possibility of an immediate loss situation if drilling into the reservoir in the 1/2 section (if the reservoir is much shallower than prognosed).  The unlikely, but possible situation of drilling through overpressured fractures in the Lista Formation or the Shetland Group generated by well A-41A. The well may then be exposed to pressures equal to the fracture propagation pressure of 1,94 g/cm3.  The possibility of instability in the lower part of the Shetland Group or in the Drake Formation in the section.

Guideline: Until temp. is minimum 50C in pit. Shear active whenever adding clay directly to active and prior to static periods. Check theology at 80 and repast in comments on the daily Oman report. Fax mud weight record from MPA on daily basis along with daily report. Maintain theology at the kny end of spec while drilling (3 rpm=8-10) to reduce pump press.

Last circulated in Octobe 2000. Barite sag expected. The annulus behind the 10 3/4' 5/8 liner is filled with Oil Based mud. Last circulated in 1993. Severe barite sag expected. Establish circulation. Displace the well to 1.605g Glydril. Take returns to separate pit and check the qua ity. Use sodium bicarbonate and citric acid as required to treat out any cement contamination. Use Soda Ash requited to increase pH. When 5/8 liner is being cut. establish circulation through annulus and displace out Oil Based mud left between 5/8 and 13 3/8. Take all returns of Oil Based Mud and contaminated Water Based Mud with oil content >1% to slop for injection. NOTE: Volume balance is nor to cutting the tie back casing. For volumes after cut at 2563 mMD. refer to program for milling section. 2563 Milling Fluid 331 COMMENTS: In case the 5/8 tie back string cannot he pulled from 2563 meter. it will be milled. Well status: The 5/8 liner is not free, and needs to be milled. Ensure that all surface lines and pits are thoroughly cleaned prior mixing. Anionic polymers from the Glydril system will damage the MMH s)stem. Displace the well from Glydril to MMH milling fluid. Refer In M- Operational Procedures. chapter 4.02. for technical recommendations for the MMH. When mixing DW and prehydrated Bentonite. add Defoamer prio to funher mixing, to avoid/reduce foaming problems. Keep close attention to the pH. Maintain pH between and by additions of premixed Soda Ash and Lime. Avoid fluctuations in pH. Be prepared to change out contaminated mud with new mud, as treatment of contaminated mud is likely to fail.Appendix Ce rogramme Well: 34/10-A41B CEMENT PROGRAM Field: Gullfaks Rig: Gullfaks HOLE CASING SHOE TOC VOLUME/ EXCESS CEMENT SLURRY DESIGN SPACER DISPLACEMENT I Components Lead Tall Density Yield Stet / Circ.
