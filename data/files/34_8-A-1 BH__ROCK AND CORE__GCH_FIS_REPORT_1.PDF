Particularly noteworthy features regarding the FIT analysis of 34 A1 BH include:  Introduction: - Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy (FIS) analysis was carried out on total of 227 cuttings samples from the 34-8-A1-BH well. Samples span the measured depth range from 3400 to 6030 m, and were sampled at 10-20 intervals. The purposes of the analysis were to characterize FIS hydrocarbon signals through the analyzed section, provide evidence for fluid compartmentalization or seals and investigate the possibility of proximal pay.  FIS Data: - Overall, FIS hydrocarbon indications can be characterized as relatively weak. Those that are present tend to be gas dominated with intermittent low concentrations of liquid-range species. Minor water-soluble anomalies are documented as well, as described below. - Anomalous methane readings are documented in thin zones throughout the analyzed section, as indicated on Track 8. The most significant anomaly occurs at 4150-4220 m, - Liquid-range species are documented in sparing amounts intermittently throughout the section as well, as indicated in Track 17. The most significant anomalies occur at 4250- - Two, thin, water-soluble anomalies (largely benzene with or without toluene) are identified at 4810-4820 and 5020-5030 m. These features are displayed best on Tracks 11, 12 and 20. The water-soluble or so called proximal pay indicators can become concentrated through diffusive transport from present-day nearby petroleum accumulations, through contribution from actively generating source rocks including coals, or through thermal destruction of liquid petroleum. In the former case, acetic acid appears to be derived from higher molecular weight petroleum compounds, hence is suggestive of liquid component to the nearby product. On the other hand, anomalies that are benzene-dominated may be sensing more gas-enriched petroleum phase. Thin section analysis does not reveal any kerogen in these intervals or evidence of thermal alteration of liquid petroleum. Hence, the soluble anomalies may be sensing nearby reservoired petroleum. - Potential seals may be present at the boundaries of FIS hydrocarbon zones indicated on Tracks and 17.  Thin Section Evaluation: - Nine thin sections were chosen on the basis of FIS results. Thin sections were evaluated under plane-polarized light and under UV illumination for their fluid inclusion populations. Visual estimation of fluorescence colors is based on observation with Nikon UV-2A filter and Fluor objectives. Any relative API gravities mentioned represent visual estimates only. These sections are documented within photomicrographs included with this report. - Fluorescent petroleum inclusions are documented in thin sections from 4180 (rare), 4290 m (rare) and 5810 (several). Inclusions tend to be yellow-white fluorescent, and appearvi to have predominantly moderate to upper moderate gravities (roughly estimated at 35- 45). Inclusions are present within healed microfractures in detrital quartz and feldspar grains. Mixed petroleum and brine inclusions are common, suggesting entrapment from mixed pore fluid system. The lithology is predominantly matrix-rich sandstone, carbonate- cemented sandstone and shale throughout the analyzed section. - Minor kerogen is documented in shale at 4290 and significant coal is observed at 5440 - No obvious residual petroleum stain is noted in any of the studied thin sections.  Summary: - Cumulatively, the data record weak hydrocarbon responses (gas and liquid-range species, but gas dominated) within thin zones throughout the analyzed section. Two thin zones at 4810-4820 and 5020-5030 contain benzene anomalies that may be sensing gas- enriched reservoired petroleum phase nearby. Several thin sections document rare to common occurrences of moderate to upper-moderate gravity petroleum inclusions. These features are outlined in Tracks (methane), 11 (benzene) 12 (toluene) 17 (C7 fragment indicative of liquids presence) and 20 (aromatics/paraffins).Depth in Kilometers -3.5 -4.0 -4.5 -5.0 -5.5 -6.0 -6.5 Rock Type Total Response CO2 AMU44 H2S AMU34 34/(34+15) 4/(4+2) 34 A1 BH : All FIS Data Air Index - 30/(30+15) Methane AMU15 Ethane AMU30 CH3COOH AMU60 Benzene AMU78 11 - Toluene AMU91 12 - 60/(60+57) 78/(78+91) Paraffins AMU57 15 - 57/(57+15) 1.4D+06 2.8D+07 4.8D+05 5.7D+06 0.0D+00 4.4D+03 0.0D+00 2.0D-02 0.0D+00 3.0D-01 0.0D+00 5.0D+00 0.0D+00 6.0D-02 1.1D+05 1.8D+06 3.2D+02 5.7D+04 0.0D+00 2.3D+03 0.0D+00 1.9D+04 0.0D+00 3.3D+03 0.0D+00 1.0D+00 0.0D+00 2.5D+02 0.0D+00 2.0D-03 0.0D+00 1.8D+03 0.0D+00 7.0D-01 0.0D+00 7.6D+02 0.0D+00 3.2D+03 0.0D+00 8.7D+00 4.0D+00 1.3D+01 3.0D-02 1.6D+00 Fluid Inclusion Technologies, Inc.

By studying the subsurface distribution of paleofluid chemistries through Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy (FIS) petroleum exploration and exploitation risk tool developed at Amoco, we obtain valuable and unique information on three major top- ics relevant to exploration: 1) Hydrocarbon Migration, 2) Seals and 3) Proximity to Reservoired Petroleum and two major topics relevant to production: 1) Pay Zone/By Passed Pay Delimitation and 2) Reservoir-Scale Compartmentallization. Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy involves the rapid, complete analysis of volatiles trapped as fluid inclusions in rock samples using quadrupole mass analyzers. The technology documents the presence and relative bulk abundance of ionized volatile fragments with mass/charge ratio of m/z 180. This includes most geologically important inorganic species as well as organic species with less than or equal to 13 carbon atoms. The resulting analysis of the petroleum fraction is comparable to the low molecular weight fraction of whole-oil gas chromatographic mass spectrometric (GCMS) analysis (without devolatilization of the gas fraction); hence, the major classes of hydrocarbons (e.g., aromatics, naphthenes and paraffins) are represented. The Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy program at FIT is unique in several ways: 1) the method- ology and theoretical framework necessary for this unique technology are the result of long-standing research and development effort, 2) the cumulative experience and database of documented case histories are the most extensive in the world and 3) the technology rep- resents the most rapid analytical capability of its kind available. In its present configuration, FIS instrumentation has the potential to analyze all available samples for 2-4 wells in 24 hr period at total cost of approximately $4000-5000 per well, thus making it one of the most inexpensive and rapid geochemical techniques available. The resulting dataset can provide nearly continuous log of paleofluid chemistries through the stratigraphic section penetrated by well, and, given adequate sample coverage, the data can be mapped in two or three dimensions. 1.1 Organization of this Report Analytical results of the FIS analysis of 34 A1 BH are presented graphically in Sections and as series of profiles each illustrating the variation of particular atomic mass (m/z) or ratio of two masses with measured depth. general discussion of the interpretation of FIS data including the significance of particular features and trends (or their absence) is provided in Section A. The remaining information provided in subsequent sections includes: 1) refer- ence spectra, collected on internal standards and used to monitor inter- and intra-analytical consistency of the quadrupole analyses which are presented and discussed in Appendix B; and 2) mass spectra for m/z 180 from all samples which are listed individually by depth in Appendix C. 1.2 Analytical Procedure Samples of rock material are freed of significant interfering contamination by washing, picking and magnetic separation to remove drilling fluids, lost circulation materials, other solid mud2 1. OVERVIEW OF FLUID INCLUSION STRATIGRAPHY additives such as gilsonite, and metallic particles from the drillstring. Cleaned samples are loaded, together with appropriate standards, into 630-hole trays, covered with metal impact slug and placed into vacuum oven at elevated temperature for minimum of 24 hour, followed by another vacuum oven at lower temperature for minimum of 24 hours. This is done to remove remaining adsorbed organic and inorganic volatile material up to C13. Sample trays are then placed into an ultra-high vacuum chamber and evacuated for approximately hours. Bulk fluid inclusion volatiles are afterwards instantaneously released from each sample in sequential manner by automated mechanical crushing. Volatile organic and inorganic species are dynamically pumped through four quadrupole mass analyzers where molecular species are ionized by electron bombardment, separated according to their mass to charge ratio (m/z) by application of combination of RF and DC fields, amplified by electron multipliers and recorded as voltage, where millivolts are approximately proportional to concentration in the ionized flow. Total run time for 630 samples is approximately 12 hours. 1.3 Output Formats Analytical results of the present study are available in electronic format as described below.

The sections were then examined under petrographic microscope using variety of fluid inclusion techniques (e.g., UV-fluorescence, microthermometry, etc.) in order to verify the presence of petroleum-bearing inclusions in the rock samples and to explore textural relationships that may yield additional information on the timing of hydrocarbon migration or generation. Petrographic examina- tion is also necessary to verify that petroleum-bearing fluid inclusions present in the samples and responsible for the observed mass spectra are not relict features (i.e., that they were not already present in the mineral grains prior to deposition). The following figures contain photomicrographs representative of samples from 34 A1 BH at the depths indicated. Figure 11: Photomicroscopy from 34 A1 BH1E 3. PHOTOMICROSCOPY Figure 12.

PHOTOMICROSCOPYAppendicesA Interpretation of FIS Data A.1 Fundamental Principle FIS analysis documents the relative abundance of ionized volatile fragments with mass/charge ratios of < m/z < 180 that have been released from fluid inclusions by crushing of natural samples. The analyses are performed using quadrupole mass spectrometer attached to an automated, high-vacuum sample introduction system. Unlike GCMS, where the quadrupole is front-ended with GC, boiling point separation is not achieved and all species are analyzed simultaneously. Hence, significant interference can occur among species with the same mass to charge ratio (e.g., CO+ and C3H+8 are both resolved at m/z = 44). Comparison of several mass responses or the general character of the mass spectrum is usually sufficient, however, to isolate the major signal contributors. The analytical conditions which we use promote the formation of dominantly singly-charged positive ions; although multiply-charged ions can occur at reduced concentration (e.g., CO2+ 2 at m/z = 22). Below is compilation of most of the masses which have been found to be useful for documenting subsurface processes with FIS. Also included is more detailed explanation of the various depth profiles which are presented in this report. A.2 Ratios vs. Absolute Abundance Both ratios of key ionized compounds as well as absolute abundances of key compounds (relative to standard Kindblade oil samples) are used in interpretation. Absolute abundances of species can be influenced by the efficiency of inclusion formation, the size distribution of the inclusions, the residence time of the fluid within the pore system and the relative proportion of fluid of given composition which moved through that stratigraphic compartment. Chemical ratios, on the other hand, are not as susceptible to lithologic/diagenetic controls on inclusion formation/distribution, hence, may be better suited for displaying chemical compartments in some cases. They are also useful for enhancing some of the subtle trends within the data, and for characterizing chemical variability among petroleum inclusion compartments which could be related to source, timing, or migration process. Ratio plots are not completely independent of inclusion abundance, as the intensity of mass spectrometer responses are somewhat non- linear with respect to ion concentration. Both types of plots should be considered during interpretation. A.3 Interpretation of Track Plots The following is synopsis of the significance of the different patterns of mass abundances and abundance ratios shown in Tracks 1-25. Note that not all species are quantified using their parent peaks (e.g., methane at m/z = 15) in order to minimize interfering contributions from other species. Track 1: Total Response - This represents the sum of the positive responses on all measured masses from < m/z < 180. These data are potentially useful for some data normalization schemes, or for estimating the relative percentage of given compound in the analyzed sample. Note that responses are generally dominated by water and carbon dioxide, and that absolute quantification is not possible because water cannot be quantitatively analyzed with this sys- tem. The polar nature of water causes it to adhere to metallic surfaces inside the instrument36 A. INTERPRETATION OF FIS DATA resulting in false readings by the detector. However, two characteristics of the total response are noteworthy. First, total responses are often orders of magnitude greater for samples yield- ing proximity spectra than for other samples originating outside the hydrocarbon zone, even though the lithologies are usually clay rich, hence low in natural inclusion abundance. This is one line of evidence which leads us to hypothesize that proximity samples are dominated by drilling induced inclusions which trap some of the present day formation fluid. Secondly, inferred petroleum migration compartments are often characterized by high total responses. This suggests that both organic and inorganic inclusions are anomalously represented within these compartments. The significance of this correlation is not fully understood, but may document fracture forming process which occurs during focused movement of basinal fluids, including petroleum. If so, it may eventually provide additional information about the nature and mechanisms of secondary petroleum migration. Track 2: m/z = 44 Dominant peak for carbon dioxide (CO+2 ), with possible minor contribution from C+3 hydrocarbon fragments and acetic acid. Anomalous values have been noted associated with pan-evaporative dolomitization of limestones in China and Oman. CO2 response is often high in proximity samples which show elevated levels of acetic acid. Track 3: m/z = 34 - Parent peak for hydrogen sulfide (H2S+). Anomalous values associated with petroleum may indicate sour oil or gas. H2S is also noted at times in association with shallow dry gas of probable biogenic origin and with some proximity zones. H2S is probably not quantitatively analyzed due to rapid scavenging by metallic surfaces of the analytical system. Track 4: 34/(34+15) - H2S/(H2S+methane). Not frequently used, but ratio tends to be elevated in sour gas zones. Track 5: 4/(4+2) - Helium fraction 4He+/(4He+ + H+2 ); ratioed to mass m/z = to indicate the presence of anomalous He. Helium anomalies have been found in association with unconfor- mities, thrust faults which sole in crystalline rocks, gas sourced from old, radioactive shales and mafic hypabyssal volcanic rocks. An abrupt change in helium abundance has been doc- umented within Precambrian rocks worldwide. It is possible that this reflects fundamental evolutionary step in the Precambrian atmosphere. Track 6: Air Confidence - This represents the results of an algorithm which performs five tests for the presence of the air components nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The plot is scaled in integer values from zero to five, corresponding to zero to five positive tests. Values in the 4-5 range indicate high confidence for air in the system (but see caution about possible leaks under above discussion on nitrogen). Air inclusions may be associated with vadose cements below paleoexposure surfaces, as well as some aeolian sands and evaporites. Track 7: 30/(30+15) - ethane/(ethane+methane). Except for very dry gas, petroleum migration zones generally show elevated ratios of ethane to methane, where that petroleum is transported as separate phase. Petroleum transported as dissolved solute species in aqueous solution (e.g., in the case of proximity) may have low ratios of ethane to methane, due to the relatively higher solubility of methane in solution. Track 8: m/z = 15 - CH+3 ; mostly derived from methane, with minor contributions from all other paraffins and NH+2 , if present. Used as relatively clean peak for methane; response is nearly as great as for the methane parent peak. Anomalies are associated with oil and gas migration as well as water zones carrying significant dissolved gas. Distinction between dry gasA.3 Interpretation of Track Plots 37 and oil is accomplished by comparing responses on higher molecular weight fragments (e.g., m/z = 97). Transport in aqueous solution is suggested by co-occurrence of other water soluble hydrocarbons as well as high ratios of water soluble to water insoluble species (e.g., 60/57, 57/55, 77/71). Methane dominated dry gas of possible biogenic origin is often documented in offshore wells at depths above 1200 m. These zones also often indicate anomalous sulfur species, which might document the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. In rapidly buried, relatively young sections, (e.g., offshore Trinidad and Gulf Coast) biogenic gas inclusions may be detected to much greater depths. Although not fully understood, if the base of these shallow biogenic zones are temperature controlled, it may provide means of establishing more accurate near-surface geothermal gradients. Track 9: m/z = 30 - Ethane parent peak (C2H+6 ). Use similar to that of methane (m/z = 15). Track 10: m/z = 60 - Acetic aid (CH3COOH), with possible contribution from COS in some envi- ronments. The standard interpretation of acetic acid anomalies in FIS data is as being sourced from oil or wet gas accumulations and transported by diffusion away from the petroleum zone through an aqueous dominated pore network. It is thought that these proximity to pay indi- cators represent samples of present day formation fluids, which are entrapped during drilling, probably through thermal and mechanical processes acting on clay-bearing lithologies in the neighborhood of the drill bit. Our understanding of the sources and sinks of organic acids and water-soluble aromatics, particularly benzene, suggest that the signal must be actively fed; hence, it is unlikely that we would see these signals preserved for geologic time in paleo- reservoirs, or along migration paths, although this has not been fully demonstrated. The strength of the signal is dependent on so many variables, including drilling conditions, lithol- ogy, formation fluid and oil chemistry, temperature, hydrodynamics, etc., that it is doubtful that quantitative assessment of distance from accumulation is possible. As with most FIS in- terpretations, documenting proximity is deemed significant, while its absence is not necessarily so, unless particular area is well calibrated. Acetic acid, in the context described above, probably is sourced by thermal processes within the reservoir in which liquid-range petroleum is broken down to lower molecular weight petroleum with one byproduct being organic acid. As such, the presence of organic acid anomalies with benzene and or toluene anomalies suggests that the accumulation has some liquid-range component, although few barrels of condensate per MMCF of gas appears to be enough to provide signal, at least in relatively low salinity formation fluids which are very close to pay zones. Other sources of organic acids are possible, including maturation of source rocks (particularly coals), severe thermal degradation of oil (particularly during thermochemical sulfate reduction) and stripping from residual oil in high Sw zones or recently flushed reservoirs; hence, the nearby reservoired hydrocarbons may very well be subeconomic. COS and acetic acid can be expected in some of the same environments, so the distinction between the two is not always possible. However, COS tends to be less water soluble, and has higher affinity for the petroleum phase than acetic acid. Track 11: m/z = 78 - Benzene (C6H+6 ). High values are associated with samples containing inclusions with liquid-range petroleum, as well as samples displaying proximity signals. distinction can be made between these two by looking at individual spectra, or by comparing the response on the relatively insoluble paraffins (e.g., m/z = 57 or 71). Note however, that some samples may indicate both oil inclusions and proximity to pay; and it is here that individual mass spectra must be studied. Such mixed spectra are indicative of some pay zones (particularly those with significant Sw, as well as zones through which petroleum has migrated, and are now water wet, but are presently in communication with the previously migrated petroleum.38 A. INTERPRETATION OF FIS DATA Track 12: m/z = 91 - Toluene (C7H+7 ). This ion is interpreted in much the same way as for benzene (m/z = 78). However, toluene has lower water solubility, so tends to be less anomalous or even absent from proximity zones. Track 13: 60/(60+57) - Acetic acid/(acetic acid + paraffins). This ratio tends to deflect to higher values in water wet zones and lower values in petroleum inclusion zones. Very high values are associated with proximity zones. Acetic acid has tremendous water solubility, while paraffins are relatively water insoluble. Track 14: 78/(78+91) - benzene/(b enzene+toluene). This ratio is of limited utility in many cases, as these species are often not abundant enough to provide coherent depth plot. In some cases, oil inclusion zones tend to deflect toward lower values, while proximity zones tend to deflect toward higher values. This is because oils typically have benzene to toluene ratios of about 0.5, while benzene has about ten times higher solubility than toluene in water. Water-washed oils will have lower ratios as will oils which have lost lighter ends through semi-permeable seal. Track 15: m/z = 57 - Paraffin fragment (C4H+9 ). Anomalous values are associated with zones of oil and wet gas inclusions. Paraffins have lower solubility than other hydrocarbon classes, hence ratioing to these can define migration and reservoir processes (see next entries). Track 16: 57/(57+15) - Paraffins/(paraffins+methane). This ratio plot displays the proportion of C4 and greater paraffins relative to methane. The ratio will generally deflect to higher values in oil inclusion zones and toward lower values in dry gas zones. The ratio will also generally decrease within proximity zones due to the high solubility of methane relative to C+4 paraffins in aqueous solution. Track 17: m/z = 97 - Alkylated naphthenes fragment (C7H+13); basically naphthenes with methyl chains. This species tends to be anomalously high in petroleum inclusion zones which contain an appreciable liquid component (e.g., oils and condensates). Track 18: 57/(57+55) - Paraffins/(paraffins+naphthenes). This ratio can be used for several pur- poses. Very low values are indicative of biodegraded oil, because bacteria prefer the paraffinic fraction. Low values are also documented in some proximity zones, due to the limited solubility of paraffins relative to naphthenes in aqueous solutions. Very high values are typical of dry gas zones as gases tend to be enriched in paraffins, although this trend must be used with caution. It is better to observe the relative change in this ratio with depth: If it decreases from baseline through petroleum inclusion zone, liquid petroleum is more likely; if it increases, lighter fraction might be expected. Again, these are generalizations which must be used cautiously. It is always best to follow up FIS work with thin section petrography to further investigate the characteristics of the entrapped petroleum phase. This ratio may also be used to pick transition zones from low to high Sw, which is useful in delineating low-contrast pay zones or transition zones. In general, we find that residual oil within water-rich zones under pay intervals tends to have higher ratios, probably due to the washing of more soluble naphthenes from the petroleum prior to entrapment. Track 19: 97/(97+91) - Alkylated naphthenes/(alkylated naphthenes + toluene). This ratio tends to deflect toward higher values in zones containing liquid petroleum inclusions and toward lower values in proximity zones. Alkylated naphthenes are relatively water insoluble as compared to toluene.A.4 Individual Spectra and Mass Assignments 39 Track 20: 77/(77+71) - C+5 paraffins/(C+5 paraffins+C+6 aromatics). This ratio tends to deflect toward higher values in zones of proximity and toward lower values in zones containing liquid petroleum inclusions. Both trends reflect the relative solubility of aromatics (high) and paraffins (low). Track 21: m/z = 64 - C+5 , S2 and SO2. Sulfur has been noted in conjunction with sour gas pools in Canada, and, along with other chemical indicators may indicate sour gas risk. Track 22: m/z = 76 - CS2 and C+6 hydrocarbons. CS2 has been found in conjunction with biodegraded subsurface seeps and as byproduct of thermochemical sulfate reduction. Track 23: 97/(15+97)*1000 - Alkylated naphthene/(alkylated naphthene + methane) Track 24: C5 - C13 Presence - This algorithm records the highest molecular weight range hydro- carbon group present in each individual spectra, and provides quick visual record of zones containing the corresponding petroleum compounds. For example, if the C5 group is the high- est molecular weight range hydrocarbon group present in given sample, ranking of is assigned; if C6 is the highest carbon number represented, then ranking of is assigned, and so on until ranking of 13 is assigned if the presence of species in the C13 range is detected. Mathematically, the algorithm tests for the presence of group (i.e., carbon number) by scan- ning the spectra for coherent signal comprised of at least two out of three of the major peaks associated with the particular molecular weight range. Track 25: C6_13/C1_5 - semi-quantitative parameter relating the abundance of liquid-range to gas-range hydrocarbons. The ratio can be used in qualitative sense to construct psuedo GOR's. A.4 Individual Spectra and Mass Assignments In addition to the Tracks 1-25 described above, mass spectra over the range m/z 180 are presented for each individual sample in Appendix C. The following descriptions contain more detailed information about species assignments for individual masses:  m/z = - Hydrogen (H+2 ); largely from H2O, which makes up most of the evolved fluid in almost all samples.  m/z = - Deuterated hydrogen and helium-3 (HD and 3He+).  m/z = 12 - Carbon (C+).  m/z = 14 - Nitrogen (N+) and CH+2 ; Nitrogen in conjunction with argon and oxygen anomalies suggests air. If not an analytical artifact (episodic burps of atmosphere leak into the analytical chamber), the presence of air may indicate vadose zone below subaerial exposure, or the presence of aeolean sand. If response on mass m/z = 14 exceeds that on masses m/z = 13 and m/z = 15 then nitrogen is likely present. CH+ will generally be accompanied by relatively larger responses on m/z = 15 (CH+3 ), and m/z = 16 (CH+4 ) (due to it's cracking origin from CH4, for instance). The most convincing distinction between analytical artifact and paleo- air occurs when several closely spaced samples have air anomalies, or when several replicate analyses of the same sample give the same result.  m/z = 16 - Parent peak for methane (CH+4 ), but major interference by O+ fragment of water.40 A. INTERPRETATION OF FIS DATA  m/z = 17 - Dominated by OH+ fragment from water  m/z = 18 - Dominated by water parent peak (H2O+)  m/z = 22 - Doubly charged carbon dioxide (CO22+); minor contribution from neon (22Ne+)  m/z = 28 - Dominated by diatomic nitrogen (N+2 ) and CO+ fragment from carbon dioxide. Minor C+2 hydrocarbon contribution  m/z = 32 - Oxygen (O+) and sulfur (S+). If m/z = 32 is larger than m/z = 31 and m/z = 33, oxygen is likely. If sulfur is present other likely peaks, such as m/z = 34 (H2S), m/z = 48 (SO+) and m/z = 64 (S+2 , SO+2 ) should be checked. Oxygen can be possible paleoexposure indicator when used in conjunction with other peaks (see discussion on Air Confidence, below, and Nitrogen above).  m/z = 40 - Argon (Ar+) with possible significant interference by C+3 hydrocarbon fragments. High value of m/z = 40 relative to adjacent m/z = 39 and m/z = 41 peaks suggests argon.  m/z = 48 - Sulfate fragment (SO+); also, C+4  m/z = 55 - Naphthene fragment (C4H+7 ). High values are found in petroleum inclusion bearing intervals. Naphthenes have intermediate solubility between aromatics and paraffins. This m/z is usually ratioed to m/z = 57 (see below).  m/z = 71 - Paraffin fragment (C5H+11). Same use as m/z = 57.  m/z = 77 - Aromatic fragment (C6H+5 ). Same general use as for benzene and toluene.  m/z = 85 - Paraffin fragment (C6H+13). Same use as m/z = 57.  95 < m/z < 103 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C7 - C8 fragments  110 < m/z < 115 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C8 - C9 fragments  122 < m/z < 126 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C9 - C10 fragments  134 < m/z < 138 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C10 - C11 fragments  148 < m/z < 152 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C11 - C12 fragments  160 < m/z < 164 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C12 - C13 fragments  175 < m/z < 180 - peaks centered within this range are mostly C13 - C14 fragmentsB Reference Spectra B.1 Oil Inclusion Reference Standards Oil inclusion reference standards (petroleum inclusion-bearing siliceous carbonate rock frag- ments) from the Kindblade Fm., Lawton, Oklahoma, are analyzed 11 times during each 630 samples. The results are given in Figure 28. These data are used to verify the effectiveness of the pneumatic impact rams as well as check sample positioning during analysis. Ideally, spectra should show whole-oil like signature with good representation of ionized fragments out to at least m/z ti 150. Daily variation occurs due to inhomogenieties in inclusion abun- dance and distribution within individual samples of this natural rock, as well as from minor instrumental fluctuations. B.2 Frac Sand Hydrocarbon Background Standards Clean quartz sand, devoid of hydrocarbons, is analyzed 22 times during each 630 samples. The results are given in Figures 29 and 30. These data are used to implement and verify the effectiveness of the background subtraction routines used in the post-analytical processing software as well as to provide check on sample positioning during analysis. Ideally, spectra should show no structured responses on m/z > 60. B.3 Cooked Frac Sand Hydrocarbon Background Standards Clean quartz sand which has been heated to 1000C to remove large percentage of the fluid inclusion population is analyzed 22 times during each 630 samples. The results are given in Figures 31 and 32. As with the frac sand standards discussed previously, these data are also used to verify the effectiveness of the background subtraction routines used in the post- analytical processing software and as check on sample positioning during analysis. Ideally, these spectra should show approximately an order of magnitude less total response than those from the preceeding Frac Sand Standard, as well as an increase in air components (e.g., nitrogen at m/z = 28; oxygen at m/z = 32; argon at m/z = 40) resulting from entrapment of air into evacuated cavities during the heating treatment. These spectra should also show little to no structured response for m/z > 60.
