The source for this survey was 160cu.in. Bolt airgun operating at constant pressure of 2000 psi. The well geophone was initially lowered into the borehole and check shots taken on the run in at 1527m, 3146m and 4151m measured depths below KB, however at 4000m the data quality was so poor that it was decided to pull the tool up again to 3146m measured depth below KB to check the quality. At this level more shots were recorded and examination of the data showed it too was poor quality therefore it was decided to pull the tool out of the borehole and use the backup tool. It is believed that the first tool failed due to silicon grease contaminating the tool. The backup well geophone was lowered to 5296m measured depth below K.B. with shots on the way into the well at 900m, 3146m and 4151m measured depth below KB. The tool was then raised at generally 20m vertical depth intervals until 3000m vertical depth below KB and then 15 shots were taken between 2991m and 600m measured depths below KB to complete the survey. A total of 124 different levels were recorded between 5296m and 600m measured depth below KB of which 107 were VSP processed between 5296m and 3146m measured depth below KB. DATA PREPARATION The VSP was produced using the processing sequence indicated on the adjoining side labels. The well geophone signals are of excellent quality. Preliminary times were picked from the first trough on the gun hydrophone signal to the first trough on the well geophone signal. These manually picked times were then modified using an automated trace alignment procedure applied to the well geophone tape data for improved timing accuracy, stacking and alignment in the V.S.P. processing. The levels above 3146m below KB were not included in the VSP as they were at too wide spacing to provide useful data. For duplicate levels only those shot in sequence have been used in the trace alignment procedure and for the VSP. A source signature deconvolution was applied to the data on trace by trace basis using an operator designed from the first 400ms of the hydrophone signals. This operator was derived by studying the consistancy of the hydrophone signals and picking a window which is considered to be representative of the source signature. This process removes the effects of the source bubble from the geophone data and also standardises the signal before processing.STACKED GEOPHONE DATA In order to investigate the frequency content of the 'raw' data an F-K analysis was performed on the edited, stacked geophone data aligned at one-way time. This shows the various prominent wavefields in the data together with the extent of their frequency bandwidths, and also any noise in the data with consistent frequency. From this the useable bandwidth of the downgoing wavefield may be established. DOWNGOING WAVEFIELD The estimate of the downwave was obtained by aligning the first arrivals at 100ms and enhancing this data in such way as to show good continuity of downgoing energy from trace to trace without distorting any real variations due to differences in structure. The waveform is reasonably consistent over the first 350ms of live data after which it tends to vary with depth. The downgoing wavefield is supplied filtered with filter to match the seismic line (Display VB2), this can be used for the identification of multiples in the seismic line (see Appendix 1A). UPGOING WAVEFIELD -The enhanced downgoing wavefield, as described above has been used in subtraction process to remove the downwave from the data leaving first estimate of the upgoing wavefield (Display VC.) A deterministic deconvolution has then been applied to the upgoing wavefield using operators derived from the downgoing wavefield on trace by trace basis. The consistent portion of the downwave data has been used to derive the deconvolution operators. comparison of Displays VE (upwave after deconvolution) and VC shows how successful the deconvolution has been in removing reverberants from the upgoing wavefield. The deconvolved downgoing wavefield Display VH also shows the effectiveness of the deconvolution operators in collapsing the downgoing wavefield, within the design window, into the first arrivals, and illustrates the wavelets that will reside in the deconvolved upgoing wavefield. In order to enhance events in the upgoing wavefields median tests were performed. range of spatial filters were applied to the data, and noise rejection filter enhancing dips between and -1 ms/trace was applied. FILTER DETERMINATION To help design filters for the displays the data has been transferred to F-K space at three stages during the processing sequence and preliminary and final bandpass filters have been designed accordingly. The optimum filter is chosen such that it is the least restrictive filter that can be applied to theupgoing wavefield to remove noise whilst retaining good resolution of the data in the zone of interest. filter of 2,5 - 40,50 Hz is considered optimum for this data set. full description of the use of the F-K transforms is included in the appendices at the back of this book. RESIDUAL WAVEFIELD In order to show any sidewaves or diffraction hyperbola present within the data set, the undeconvolved data with both upwaves and downwaves subtracted is displayed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DISPLAYS SUPPLIED The VSP displays supplied are essentially of two-types. Displays included in the VSP book report are intended for use as quality control displays, showing each major stage in the processing. Loose leaf displays are intended as working copies and are produced at time scale to match the seismic line (10cm/s) detailed description of each display is contained in the appendices at the back of this book. Displays VG1 show the VSP convolved with the zero phase optimum frequency filter designed for the VSP. REMARKS As has been mentioned in the log calibration comment, the data shows jump in the times between 2850 and 3200m vertically below KB of about 42ms one-way. time as compared to the log data. The log was calibrated assuming that the shallow data was at correct times and the deeper data was in error, however no time correction has been applied to the deeper data as it is deemed better to leave the times as recorded thus making clear the problem rather than correcting the times and masking the problem. If it is assumed that the deeper data is infact incorrect then the VSP displays presented here are at times 84ms too short and will therefore not dirrectly match the seismic line or the synthetic seismogram derived from the log data.

Displays Deviated Well: Variable Offset Source (Vertical incidence) Unless otherwise stated, all displays are plotted against true horizontal offset rather than depth. Display VA (Stacked Geophone Data at' one-way time) This display indicates the quality of the data used in the subsequent VSP processing. The trace displayed for each geophone position is the result of editing, as appropriate, and summing common depth traces; the common depth traces having undergone trace alignment procedure (based on cross correlation) in order to obtain accurate alignment prior to summation. Source signature deconvolution will have been applied to marine data, unless otherwise stated, using the gun hydrophone signal as source signature. Wavelet stabilisation may optionally have been applied to the data to remove variations in source character due to changing source conditions, (particularly onshore) and/or variation in geophone coupling. A broad band filter will have been applied to this data in order to remove noise without compromising the usable bandwidth of the data. The polarity of this display is such that the first downgoing arrival is plotted as black peak. (SEG normal polarity) Display VA(FK) (F-K Display of Stacked Geophone Data at One-Way Time) This display shows the stacked geophone data (after source signature deconvolution, if appropriate) at one-way time transformed into F-K space. This data is displayed as wave number (K) against frequency, with variation in colour indicating amplitude in dB below the maximum amplitude. A velocity alignment in T-X space transforms to an alignment in F-K space, rotated through 90; the various wavefields (i.e. velocity alignments) commonly observed in T-X space transform into F-K space as illustrated in Fig.1 The strongest wavefield will normally be the Downgoing wavefield and this transforms into an alignment from zero wave number, zero frequency sloping in. the positive wave number direction. Significant velocity changes in wavefield will result in multiple alignments in F-K space; although in practice it may not be possible to differentiate between the different F-K alignments and the resulting event may be smeared. /Cont'd....The data may be split into sections before transformation, in order to allow better analysis. The likely reasons for treating the data in this way are: to separate out areas of differing velocity, differing data quality, differing geophone separation or differing bandwidth. When alignments intercept the or -1 axis they will 'wrap around'. The frequency at which the intercept occurs is the fundamental alias frequency; further aliasing will occur at harmonics of this frequency. It should be noted that the resolution of the VSP data, after wavefield separation, is not limited by the fundamental alias frequency. The effects of spatial aliasing on the data will be small and, in particular, after application of non-linear spatial filters (i.e. our normal method of enhancing the data) the aliasing effects can be assumed to be negligible. This display illustrates, in convenient form, the various prominent wavefields in the data together with the extent of their frequency bandwidths, the general noise level and specific noise problems. In addition to general data analysis, it is used to establish the usable bandwidth of the Downgoing Wavefield in order to design the broad band preliminary filter applied to the data in Display VA. Display VB (Downgoing Wavefield) This display represents series of downgoing wavefields observed at successive locations (i.e. geophone positions) in the borehole. This display is produced by shifting the data as shown in Display VA so that the direct arrivals, and therefore the Downgoing Wavefield are aligned in time; spatial filter is then applied to remove random noise and crossing wavefields. The downgoing wavefield trace extracted for each geophone position describes fully the multiple systems that will occur as tail to reflector at or. near that geophone position. comparison of downgoing wavefield with reflection occurring at the same depth on the seismic section at the well, will reveal any residual multiple activity on the seismic section associated with that particular reflector. For this exercise the observed polarity of the reflection on the seismic section should be matched with the same polarity first arrival on the VSP downgoing wavefield, i.e. white trough matched to white trough or black peak to black peak. In the same manner the downgoing wavefield display can be correlated with the upgoing wavefield of Displays VC and VD to establish the presence and origin of multiples within the VSP data. Note that this display is provided in two forms: (a) VB1 : filtered with the broad band preliminary filter only. This display essentially shows the data from which the deconvolution operators have been derived. (b) VB2 : filtered so that the bandwidth matches that of the seismic data, in the zone of interest, to enable identification of residual multiples in the seismic data. This version is presented at the scale(s) of the seismic section. These displays are produced at both polarities. /Cont'd...Displays VC and VD (Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; before and after enhancement) These displays show the Primary and Multiple activity observed at the borehole location from the shallowest VSP geophone position to some way vertically below the deepest VSP geophone position (and therefore, normally, some way vertically below Total Depth of the borehole) and over the lateral extent of the Well. The data shown on Display VD is that of Display VC after application of spatial filter; this spatial filter will be the result of various trials and will have been chosen to give the best enhancement of the upgoing events (horizontal and/or dipping) observed in the data. In marine data, if source signature deconvolution has been applied, then the input wavelet will be zero-phase and the wavelet contained in the data will be zero phase modified by earth absorption and transmission loss effects (i.e. mixed phase). In the case of onshore data, if neither wavelet stablisation nor source signature deconvolution has been applied, then the source signature remains in the data. Wavelet stabilisation can be carried out by shaping to any given wavelet; we would recommend, however, that all geophone data is transformed to the waveform of shallow geophone level. In this case then the source signature effectively remains in the data but is made consistent from level to level. Events that reach the time-depth curve are primary and their lithologic significance can be established unequivocally by reference to the calibrated velocity log. This comparison can be made using Display VG1 which contains the data from Display VF and the calibrated velocity log at the scale(s) of the seismic section. See comments on the velocity log calibration method later in these notes. Multiples having their last bounce from primary within the range of the VSP may be identified by observing their termination in the data at the same depth point at which the primary cuts the time-depth curve. This data will normally have been filtered using the 'optimum' filter designed after F-K analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield. Display VC(FK) (F-K Display of Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time: before enhancement) This display shows the Upgoing Wavefield, at two-way time, transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation will be detailed on the side label. General Comments on F-K displays, made under Display VA(FK) also apply to this display. Since the Upgoing Wavefield is aligned horizontally, or near-horizontally, in T-X space (unless there is steep dip across the Well location) it is aligned vertically, through zero wave number, in F-K space.This display, together with Display VE(FK) is used to establish the usable frequency bandwidth of the Upgoing Wavefield to aid design of the so-called 'optimum' filter applied to the data in Displays VC, VD, VE, VF, VG1 and Vii. The 'optimum' filter is the least restrictive filter that can be applied to the Upgoing Wavefield to remove noise whilst retaining good resolution of the data in the zone of interest (if the zone of interest is not known, then it is assumed to be just above T.D. of the well). For thii reason, the F-K analysis is performed on data within window around the zone of interest. Additionally the data is windowed in time so that the data close to the Time-Depth curve, where we would expect better resolution, is analysed. illThis analysis and the F-K analysis of the Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield indicat the limits of the frequency bandwidth in the data. Based on these guidelines, filter trials will be carried out and the 'optimum' filter chosen from the resuII ; Displays VE and VF (Deconvolved Upgoing_Wavefield at two-way time; II These displays show the data as in Display VC after application of determiniF deconvolution using operators derived from the Downgoing Wavefield, on trace by trace basis. The effect of the deconvolution will be to remove all reverbera :si associated with at least one reflector above the geophone position from which the dawngoing.wavefield has been extracted. The deconvolution is applied in spiking mode, unless otherwise stated, and II the phase of the resulting data will be function of the filter applied after deconvolution. This is normally zero phase filter giving zero phase result and maximum resolution of the lithology within the band limits. At the client's discretion any other phase filter can be utilised. The data shown on Display VF is that of VE after enhancement by application of a spatial filter as described for Display VD. These displays describe the primary reflection response of the subsurface at the borehole location within the limits of the depth and offset range of the VSP geophone positions and additionally the primary reflection response vertically below the deepest VSP level. This data can be interpreted directly in terms of lithology, structure and stratigraphy, as with conventional surface seismi( data. The data is two dimensional in that source and receiver are co-planar and in the presence of dipping beds migration will occur. The migration effects are such that at the time-depth curve there is no migration and the reflection events are in their correct subsurface position. As the geophone moves up the well away from any reflector then the reflecting point will move deviation then this effect can be fully assessed, but if the dips are out of up-dip as in the case of the vertical VSP. If the dip is in the plane of the the plane of the deviation, then out of the plane migration will occur which cannot be recovered. This effect is analogous to 2-D surface seismic data. When using this response, the accurate prediction of acoustic impedance variation below TD will depend on the geometry of the subsurface below the deepest VSP level.Display VE(FK) (F-K Display of Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time; before enhancement) This display shows the Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield, at two-way time, transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation will be detailed on the side label. All general Comments made under Display VC(FK) also apply to this display. The same analysis window will be used in the F-K transformation of both the Upgoing and the Deconvolved Upgoing wavefields; the resulting displays [VC(FK) and VE(FK)] will mainly differ in areas of low amplitude on the VC(FK) display which will be boosted during deconvolution. Display VH (Deconvolved Downgoing Wavefield at two-way time) This display is included to indicate the wavelets that will reside in the deconvolved upgoing wavefields of Displays VE and VF. It also serves to illustrate how effective the inverse operator is at collapsing the downgoing wavefield from which it has been designed. Reverberants with periods longer than the operator length used will remain in this display and will indicate some of the multiples that will be retained in displays VE and VF (Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield). In order to afford direct comparison in time with Displays VE and VF, the wavelets have been shifted to their two-way time position before display. The side-lobe activity of the wavelets is most likely to be function of the filter applied after the application of the inverse operator. This level of 'side-lobe' will also be present in Displays VE and VF. Display VI (Residual Wavefield at one-way time) In this display both the upgoing and downgoing wavefields have been removed. Most VSP data contains many other events in addition to the vertical upgoing and downgoing wavefields. Reflections from fault planes, diffraction energy from point diffractors near the borehole and mode converted shear (SV) energy are some of the possible events which will be revealed by this display. Additionally, residual tube wave energy will also be identified when present. The interpretation of these types of events are difficult except for diffraction hyperbolae and some fault plane reflections. This display is produced at SEC normal polarity only. /cont'd...Display VG (Interpreter's Composite) This display is designed for use in interpretation and is therefore presented at the scale(s) of the seismic section. It contains the enhanced, deconvolved upgoing wavefield and the calibrated 11 velocity log (see comments on calibrated velocity log and Synthetic Seismogram displays below). If Synthetic Seismogram processing has been carried out then this display will also include the formation density log (if available), acoustic impedance log, reflection coefficient series and the Synthetic Seismogram responses 'Primaries Without Transmission loss' and 'Primaries plus short term multiples'. Additionally, the Synthetic Seismogram 'Primaries Without Transmission Loss' response, repeated to match the spacing of the VSP traces, is usually spliced to the deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield display along the line which marks the location of the deviated well in seismic reflection time and offset distance. This allows direct comparison between the VSP and Synthetic Seismogram data. Note that all comments made in the description of Display VF are relevant to the enhanced, deconvolved upgoing wavefield included in this display. Two versions of this display will normally be produced (both at-seismic scale(s)) VG1: Filtered using the 'optimum' filter designed after FK analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield. VG2: Filtered with the filter used in seismic processing. Calibrated Velocity Log Display: Assuming that both static rig source and variable offset source surveys were carried out in the Well, then the velocity log will normally be calibrated in two different ways: (a) Using the rig source data to correct the log for borehole effects. This log will have reliable interval velocities (and therefore reflectivity) but will not necessarily be tied to true vertical times. This log will be included in the Log Calibration Report. (b) Using the variable offset data to tie the log to true vertical times. Note that this log will not necessarily exhibit correct interval velocities since the travel times for consecutive levels may correspond to travel paths through different parts of the subsurface so that interval times (and therefore velocities) between consecutive levels may be meaningless. This log will also be included in the log calibration report, but is the version of the calibrated velocity log which will be included in the Interpreter's Composite Display.Synthetic Seismogram Display: To produce reliable Synthetic Seismogram, we need log tied to true vertical times but with correct reflectivity. In order to achieve this the log is calibrated using the variable offset data as described above; the unrealistic reflection coefficient series obtained from the log calibrated in this way is then edited with reference to the correct reflectivity series obtained from the velocity log calibrated using the rig source data (which gives correct reflectivity but is not tied to true vertical times). Display Polarities Polarities of displays in the VSP report obey the SEC conventions throughout and displays are labelled 'POLARITY  SEC NORMAL' or 'POLARITY  SEC REVERSE' as applicable.

The source for this survey was 160cu.in. Bolt airgun operating at constant pressure of 2000 psi. The well geophone was initially lowered into the borehole and check shots taken on the run in at 1527m, 3146m and 4151m measured depths below KB, however at 4000m the data quality was so poor that it was decided to pull the tool up again to 3146m measured depth below KB to check the quality. At this level more shots were recorded and examination of the data showed it too was poor quality therefore it was decided to pull the tool out of the borehole and use the backup tool. It is believed that the first tool failed due to silicon grease contaminating the tool. The backup well geophone was lowered to 5296m measured depth below K.B. with shots on the way into the well at 900m, 3148m and 4151m measured depth below KB. The tool was then raised at generally 20m vertical depth intervals until 3000m vertical depth below KB and then 15 shots were taken between 2991m and 600m measured depths below KB to complete the survey. total of 124 different check level depths were recorded. WELL GEOPHONE SURVEY The well geophone signal first arrivals are fairly good quality. Preliminary times were picked from the first trough  on the gun hydrophone signal to the first trough on the well geophone signal. The manually picked times were then modified using an automated trace alignment procedure applied to the well geophone tape data for improved timing accuracy, alignment and stacking in the V.S.P. processing. For duplicate levels only those shot in sequence have been used in the automated trace alignment process. Shots on the way into the well were compared with the same levels shot during the survey, the hand picked times agree to within lms and the well geophone signals are very similar.Where possible, interval velocities have been selected at about 100m depth intervals for the computations and the same levels have been used in the sectional display of well geophone data. ACOUSTILOGS Log runs to have been used in the calibration. There are gaps between runs and 2, and and and of 15m, 10m and 5m measured depth respectively. These gaps have )been modelled at the general level of the adjacent log and the log has been treated as continous in the calibration. The logs have been edited and re-integrated before calibration ACOUSTILOG CALIBRATION Comparison of the log times against the check level times was made and the resulting drift curve shows some unusual trends. There is large shift in the Tl-Tc times between 2850m and 3200m vertical depth below KB indicating possibly that the media through which the recorded seismic wave was travelling was of an anomalously high velocity leading to large reduction in the check level time as compared to the log data. This change in times appears to take place over the said interval and is about 42 ms. After exmination of the data two methods of calibration were arrived at. The first assumes that the shallow data is at its correct time, that the deeper data has travelled through some high velocity medium and that the Tc times do not represent true vertical times. However it is assumed that the deeper check levels are all similarly affected and that the shifts indicated below 3200m measured depth below KB are correct but shifted in time. Therefore method one time ties the log to the shallow data and following the shifts implied by the deeper data but ignores the 42 ms shift. The second method assumes that the deeper data below 3200m vertical depth below KB is at its correct time and that the shallow data is somehow at too long time. This method therefore time ties the log to the deeper data and contineus the implied shift back to the top of the log. Both method were presented to Amoco Norway and after discussions it was decided that method one should be used to produce the final report. All the data presented in the final report was produced using method 1. This method has resulted in velocity above the top of the recorded log of 1892m/s (161.1 us/ft) which is considered reasonable. It is assumed that the levels below 3200m vertically below KBSCHENAT CROSS-SECTION KELLY BUSHING EKB.
