The resistivity log is corrected for borehole conditions and both Apparent Resistivity (RSAX) and Corrected Resistivity (RSCX) are presented on the log. The Gamma Detector is Scintillation device, calibrated to API units. The Computerized Directional Sensor (CDS) provides directional surveys (Toolface, Azimuth and Inclination) and downhole circulating temperature. DUAL PROPAGATION RESISTIVITY (DPR) TOOL The Dual Propagation Resistivity (DPR) tool comprises of resistivity sensor which measures resistivity by emitting MHz electromagnetic wave into the formation. This wave is monitored by the two receiving antennaes, spaced apart, hence giving outstanding bed definition. The sensor measures the Phase Difference (PD) and Amplitude Ratio (AR) for the wave, which are transformed mathematically into resistivity values. The two resistivity measurements have different depths of investigation. The Amplitude Ratio Resistivity (PAR) reads deepest into the formation, while Phase Difference Resistivity (RPD) is the most accurate at high resistivities and offers the best vertical resolution. The tool also includes Computerized Directional Sensor (CDS) giving directional surveys (Toolface, Azimuth and Inclination) and downhole circulating temperature. The Scintillation Gamma ray detector is calibrated to the MWD-API standard. In addition, the tool features downhole memory, which samples data every six seconds. The sampling time is programmable and can be changed on the rig. Realtime data is transmitted to the surface. When the DPR tool is raised above the RKB, the memory is dumped and the data processed in order to produce high quality log with excellent definition and detail. Hence the DPR tool provides both real-time data (Measurement-While Drilling, MWD data) and memory data (Recorded While Drilling, RWD data). MODULAR TRIPLE COMBO TOOL The Teleco Modular Triple Combo tool comprises of the same sensors as the DPR tool, (directional, temperature, gamma ray and DPR resistivity) in addition to the Modular Neutron Porosity tool and Modular Density Lithology tool. -1-TELECO DATA TRANSMISSION The Teleco tool transmits data to the surface by positive pressure pulse modulated on the standpipe pressure. The pressure pulse is generated by piston moving towards valve seat, temporarily restricting the flow and causing pressure increase. There are at the moment two ways of transmitting the binary (ones and zeros) stream of digits to the surface. BIPHASE CODE The transmitted data consists of stream of binary digits (ones and zeros). Each bit takes certain length of time, one data cell width, to transmit. Independent of the data rate, bit is represented by a level change (valve motion) at the start of the bit. bit has level change at the start and middle of the bit. Consequently each bit requires either one or two movements by the piston. The Biphase code performs well under difficult decoding conditions. MILLER CODE Miller code is an alternative to Biphase code. It requires less valve motions to transmit the same number of bits. This means that the transmission frequency can be lowered, while the data rate is maintained. With Miller x4M we get the same valve movement as with the X2 Biphase, but twice as much data is transmitted to the surface. is presented by level change in the middle of the bit. has no level change, unless it is followed by another 0, in which case there is level change at the end of the first bit period. SPLITPHASE CODE New generation Teleco MWD tools will have the ability to be programmed for splitphase code. This is new method of data transmission that allows the same high data rate as the Miller code, while being more robust and allowing more signal noise. With splitphase is represented by negative going level change in the middle of the bit, while is represented by positive going level change (pressure rise) in the middle of the bit. 4.11.4 TIME PER DATA BIT FOR THE DIFFERENT CODES X2 BIPHASE X3 BIPHASE X4 MILLER X6 MILLER X4 SPLITPHASE X6 SPLITPHASE (X2B) (X3B) (X4M) (X6M) (X4 S) (X6S) 2.50 sec/bit 1.67 sec/bit 1.25 sec/bit 0.83 sec/bit -2-Tflif.c.

The tool was laid down at Saga's request. MAINTENANCE COMMENTS: The tool was flowloop tested and was confirmed to be operating to specification. All sub-assemblies were tested and were found to meet acceptance criteria. DHB 2266-22 (DPR X4S) was picked up with the same range of turbine as the previous tool and the same decoding problems were encountered in the pilot hole with the lower flow rates used. When the flow rates were increased during the 36 hole opening and 17 1/2 pilot hole the tool operated to specification. The tool accumulated circulating hours. MAINTENANCE COMMENTS: The tool was flowloop tested on return and was confirmed to be operating to specification. The sub-assemblies were tested and found to meet acceptance criteria. 17 1/2 HOLE SECTION DMA 8414-05 (RGD X4S) was used in bit runs to TD the 17 1/2 hole section. The tool performed to specification throughout and accumulated 118.5 circulating hours. MAINTENANCE COMMENTS: The tool was flowloop tested on return and confirmed to be operating to specification. All sub-assemblies were 12 1/4 HOLE SECTION DMA 866-40 (MODULAR FE X4S) was used in bit run to TD the 12 1/4 hole section. Problems were encountered at 2091m when pressure increase was observed and later on the tool began transmitting weak pulses. Due to the fact that good memory log was obtained it is suspected that the problems were due to debris blocking the tool. MAINTENANCE COMMENTS: The tool has been returned to Aberdeen for repair testing and recalibration.IMINNIII TELECO TOOL UTILIZATION  COMPANY: SAGA PETROLEUM A/S JOB NO: NOR 434 WELL NO: 25/6-2 TOOL TYPE TOOL NO.

The well position is on the Utsira High, west of the main fault in the southern part of the block. The well was drilled vertically, with surveys provided by Teleco MWD tools. For the 36 and 17 1/2 pilot hole sections an 1/4 DPR tool was used. For the 17 1/2 hole, 1/4 RGD tools were used. In the 12 1/4 hole DPR service was requested, but Teleco took the opportunity to demonstrate the 1/4 Modular Triple Combo tool that included Neutron Porosity and Density in addition to DPR. Please see the Tool Definition report for further details on the tool types. 9 7/8 PILOT FOR 36 HOLE 145m - 370m RUN # 1. 145m - 196m ROTARY HOLD ASSY The well was spudded with 7/8 BHA comprising of Hughes ATJIS bit with 3x20 nozzles, bit sub, nm p/p sub, MWD, saver sub, monel, DC 11, jar, DC 3, x/o and HWDP 1. The Teleco DPR tool No.8404-10 (450-900 GPM) was picked up and verified at surface before the assembly was run in hole without marine riser and BOP. Started spudding with very little flow, around GPM. This was too little to get good log while drilling. When taking surveys, the same problem occurred. The tool sent just numbers for gamma and resistivity readings. This is clear indication of insufficient flow rate, as the tool does not power up the logging sensors. Due to problems with washing out the hole with an increased flowrate, it was decided by Saga representative to pull out to change the Teleco tool. Two directional surveys were taken during this run, showing an inclination of degrees at the end. The tool accumulated 2.1 circulating hours. RUN # 196m - 370m ROTARY HOLD ASSY After changing the Teleco tool to DPR No.2266-22, the assembly was run in hole and the spudding continued from 196m. Same decoding problems, caused by insufficient flowrate, was encountered by this tool as well. After the Saga representative agreed to increase the flowrate to around 500 GPM, decoding problems were no longer causing problems, other than when taking surveys. -1-Several tries to get the correct FID was necessary. The bad decoding experienced was probably caused by the pressure drop in standpipe when pulling the bit off bottom when taking the surveys. In order to get high enough SPP to get survey flowrate of 610 GPM was needed. This was the highest flowrate that could be used before washing out the hole. Even with these flowrates the first three of total of surveys, failed to give correct FID, and had to be taken over again. These problems were not encountered below 236m. The realtime log suffered from the lack of appropriate flow and several passages with too high ROP. An excellent memory log, which showed possible shallow gas area around 274m, was produced and presented to the customer. total of directional surveys were taken throughout the run with final inclination of degrees and direction of 136.2 degrees. The tool accumulated circulating hours. 36 HOLE SECTION 145m - 258m 145m - 258m 36 HOLE OPENER For the 36 hole opening 26 bit was placed before the holeopener and the same Teleco tool as the previous run. The MWD was utilized mainly to check the well path and to avoid possible kick-off. The realtime log produced was of good quality, but showed more trends than actual value due to the large hole diameter. The readings actually reflected seawater more than true formation. A total of directional surveys were taken during this run with final inclination of degrees and azimuth of degrees at 245m. The tool accumulated circulating hours. 258m - 1045m ROTARY HOLD ASSY After running the 30 casing, riser and SBD (seabed diverter) were installed prior to drilling ahead. The cement and shoe was drilled out with 26 bit and underreamer. 17 1/2 assembly was built comprising of a: REED MS13G bit with lx17, 3x22 nozzles, bit sub w/float, x/o, nm p/p sub, MWD, saver sub, monel, x/o, 17 1/2 stab, x/o, DC, x/o, 17 1/2 stab, x/o, DC 12, jar, DC 3, x/o, HWDP 1, Dart sub and HWDP x 9. The same Teleco tool No. 2266-22 was used in this pilot hole. The tool was not tested on surface on Saga's request. The assembly was run in hole and tagged bottom at 261m. Commenced drilling with flowrate between GPM with SPP of 2 psi. The WOB varied between - 15 tonnes while the RPM stayed between . These parameters gave an average ROP of in/hr of this run. Wiper trips to the 30 casing shoe was performed at 545m and 817m. TD of the pilot hole was set to 1045m. The hole was circulated clean prior to pulling out to open the hole to 26. total of 28 directional surveys were taken throughout this run showing very steady inclination with final of degrees and with an azimuth of 86.7 degrees at 1037m. No problems with the down hole equipment was seen during this run, and the tool accumulated circulating hours. -2-For the 26 hole opening no services from Teleco were requested, and the tool was laid down as RGD tools were planned to be used in the 17 1/2 hole section. The hole was opened to 26 without any incidents, and the riser and seabed diverter were pulled in preparation to run the 20 casing. During this operation gas bubbles were seen at the seabed by the ROV camera, and corrective action had to be taken. Ran the drill string back to bottom and established circulation, and the mudweight was increased in steps up to SG. The 20 casing was set at 1030m, and the BOP and riser were installed prior to starting to drill. 1045m - 1388m PENDULUM ASSEMBLY Made up rotary drop assembly, comprising of 17 1/2 Smith SS44J4 rockbit with lx16 and 3x18 nozzles, the Teleco RGD tool (SN 8414-5), and 17 1/2 stabilizer placed 23.11m above the bit. The Teleco tool was tested to specification at the first HWDP. Ran in to the top of the cement at 1015m, and drilled cement and float to 1030m. The hole was displaced to SG KCL mud prior to drilling the shoe and cleaning out the rat hole. Drilled another 5m of fresh formation to 1051m and circulated and conditioned the mud prior to performing the LOT, which gave EQMW. This was sufficient to continue drilling. The mudweight was increased while drilling, in preparation of the forthcoming pore-pressure rise. Drilling resumed using the following drilling parameters: 137 RPM, 865 GPM, 10-15 tonnes WOB, at 2300 psi, and gave an ROP between 15 - 25 in/hr. The decoding under these conditions were 100% efficient, and good formation log was recorded. To maintain the rate of penetration the WOB had to be increased to 20 tonnes at 1169m, and accordingly the flow adjusted up to 1000 GPM to optimize hole cleaning. The following surveys showed an inclination build rate, and gave deg at 1271m. Several adjustments were carried out, the WOB was decreased to 5-10 tonnes and the RPM increased to 170. The alterations had limited effects, the angle still showed gradual build and gave maximum reading of deg at 1328m. With the increasing angle the well path direction started to align to around 220-230 deg. The high possibility of missing the first target at 2096m with the present inclination build up rate, led to the decision to POOH at 1388m. The hole packed off at 1363m, resulting in total loss of circulation. Circulation was re-established and the string was backreamed to the 20 casing shoe. Circulated and rotated inside the casing in an attempt to free the string for attached gumbos. Ran back in hole and circulated bottoms up prior to POOH. The tool performed to specification and accumulated total of circulating hours. -3-S 1388m - 1609m PACKED ASSEMBLY A packed assembly comprising of HTC MAX G3 bit, dressed with lx16 and 3x18 nozzles, and the same Teleco RGD tool as in the previous run was made up and run in hole. The Saga drilling supervisor requested that the MWD tool was not tested on surface. Ran in to bottom and started drilling with 20 tonnes WOB, RPM of 160 and flow of 910 GPM, giving standpipe pressure of 3300 psi and ROP between 15 - 20 in/hr. survey at 1399m gave an inclination of deg. This angle built to deg at 1428m and further to deg at 1457m. Lower WOB was tried in order to drop angle but to no avail. Throughout the run the angle kept building until the final survey at 1599m which showed an angle of deg. The direction varied between 227.4 deg and deg, corrected to grid north. At 1609m it was decided to pull out of hole to make up motor assembly in order to drop angle.  RUN #  1609m - 1911m MOTOR ASSEMBLY A correction run had to be performed, so motor assembly was built. The BHA comprised of Hughes MAX G3 rock bit dressed with 4x20 nozzles, Navi Drill MKII mud-motor, 17 1/4 sleeve stab, the Teleco RGD tool (S/N 8414-5), another 16 1/2 sleeve stab, the Jar and total of std of DC's and HWDP's. The Teleco tool was not tested on surface on Sagas request. Ran in hole to 1570m, and washed down to bottom. Drilled ahead in alternating steering and rotating mode, using drilling parameters as: 1000 GPM, 10-20 tonnes WOB, 60 surface RPM, giving stand-pipe pressure of 3700 psi. To avoid key-seatings the plan was to turn the well path and control the drop rate, by keeping the toolface around 120 deg R. Some problems were experienced during steering, it was difficult to maintain the optimum toolface region, due to frequent limestone stringers. The actual toolface range during drilling were around deg R, and the well path direction gradually turned to the right while the inclination dropped off as desired. The survey taken at 1698m survey depth gave an inclination of deg and an azimuth of 251.3. Drilling resumed and the angle continued to drop and gave deg at 1780m survey depth. The recorded azimuths varied bit more, due to the relatively low angle. A wiper trip to the shoe was performed at 1800m, and no tight spots were experienced when POOH. Ran back in hole, and reamed down the last stand. Drilling resumed with the objective to change the well path coordinates to the original target centre. At 1911m the assembly was pulled out of hole due to stalling of the mudmotor. -4-1911m - 2050m PENDULUM ASSEMBLY The Navi Drill mudmotor was laid down and the same assembly as in Teleco run #5 was made up and run in hole. The MWD tool was not tested on surface due to request from Saga's representative. Commenced drilling with 15 - 20 tonnes WOB, RPM of 165, flow of 970 GPM giving ROP of 10 - 15 m/hr. number of directional surveys were taken during this run. At the start the angle was dropping off from deg at 1912m to deg at 1998m. Towards the end the hole was building angle again, deg at the final survey at 2043m. TD for the section was set to 2050m and wiper trip to the 20 casing shoe was made prior to pulling out of hole. The 17 1/2 hole was logged with wireline before the 13 3/8 casing was set at 2026m. For the 12 1/4 section Teleco supplied the logging with a Field Test of 1/4 Modular tool (triple combo). This tool measures Neutron Porosity and Formation Density in addition to the normal DPR tool. The tool gives both realtime and memory logs. 2050m - 2392m PACKED ASSEMBLY Made up new assembly comprising of: 12 1/4 HTC ATXG3 bit with 4x14 nozzles, 12 1/4 NB stab w/float, P/P sub, Junk sub, NM P/P sub, MWD tool, Saver sub, Monel, 12 1/4 Stab, DC 14, Jar, DC 8, X/0, HWDP, Dart sub and HWDP 9. At surface the Teleco tool was verified to specifications. The radioactive sources were loaded into the tool, and the assembly was run in hole after testing the tool with flow. Tagged the cement at 1999m. Drilled out the cement, float, shoe and cleaned out the rathole down to 2050m. The new formation was drilled down to 2053m prior to performing the LOT to SG. Resumed drilling with drilling parameters: WOB 10 - 25 tonnes, RPM around 180, Flowrate between GPM with SPP from 0 psi. At 2091m sudden pressure increase of some 600 psi occurred, and the tool stopped pulsing. Continued drilling, and after about 70m the tool started pulsing again with very small pulses. It is most likely, the pulser valve of the tool had been blocked by some debris. This debris was then probably washed away, to some extent, as drilling continued. This is substantiated by the fact that complete memory log was obtained over this section. There was no problem decoding these pulses, and good realtime log was obtained. A wiper trip was performed at 2188m. At 2265m the Top Drive had failure, and the bit was pulled back to 2217m. While repairing the top drive it was circulated and rotated. The flow was too low to get any decoding. After fixing the top drive, the lost realtime data was relogged from 2089m to 2192m (bit depth), with logging speed of approximately 25 m/hr at 60 RPM, before drilling continued down to 2336m where the top drive failed again. After repairing the top drive, a wiper trip to the casing shoe was performed before drilling continued down to TD of the well at 2392m. The realtime transmission stopped at 2368m bit depth. -5-The hole was circulated clean and wiper trip to the shoe was performed prior to pulling out for running wireline. The tool accumulated hours and the MWD services ended at 2387m sensor depth. When laying down the tool, debris was found on top of the poppet valve. This caused the problems with the transmission. The MWD services from Teleco ended at 2392m. -6-TE1-,f.c.c SONAT TELECO SENSOR OFFSET FROM BITCOMPANY: SAGA PETR. A/8 JOB No: NOR 434 WELL No: 25/6-2 RUN NO. TOOL NO.

DPR tools were utilized in the 7/8 and 17 1/2 pilot hole sections. For the 17 1/2 hole section RGD tools were provided. In the 12 1/4 section the Modular Triple Combo tool was utilized. This gives Neutron Porosity and Density logs in addition to the requested DPR service. The final logs are available in 1:500 MD and 1:200 MD scales. MWD (real-time) logs are supplied where the RGD tool was used, while RWD (memory) logs are available for the rest of the well. 9 7/8 PILOT HOLE SECTION 145m - 370m INTRODUCTION: Teleco DPR-RAW tools (S/N 8404-10 and S/N 2266-22) were used on this hole section primarily to detect shallow gas, which was predicted at +- 240m and +- 310m. The section was completed in two runs to 370m. No wireline logs were run, and the MWD log was accepted as the final log of the section. The pilot hole was then opened to 36 with the same tool from 145m to 258m. TOOL PERFORMANCE: Due to low flowrate (425-470 gpm), tool No. 8404-10 had problems getting initiated and was laid down after drilling down to 196m. The tool gave very few datapoints due to the low flowrate, and no continuous log was obtained from 145-194m. Tool No. 2266-22 gave very good memory log down to TD of the pilot section at 368m (sensor depth). Also with this tool the flowrate was occasionally low and gave small gaps in the realtime log. The data density on the real-time log was poor at some intervals due to very high ROPs as well. LOGGING CONDITIONS: The 7/8 pilot hole section was drilled without marine riser and BOP-stack. Drilling fluid used was seawater with MW = SG, supplied with high-visc. pills. The ROP stayed between 20 - 100 m/hr throughout the section. The formation consisted mostly of claystone interbedded with sandstone stringers. Shallow gas was indicated at 274m. -1-17 1/2 PILOT HOLE SECTION 261m - 1045m A DPR-RAW tool (SN 2266-22) was utilized in this hole section, with the purpose to detect possible shallow gas horizons. No wireline logs were run, so the MWD log was accepted as the final log for the section. The tool performed to specification throughout the section. It must be noted that the flowrates used during drilling 970-990 GPM, were higher than the specified setup of the tool turbine, and were not recommended by Teleco engineers on site. These precautions are set in order to prevent excessive turbine wear, and thus prolong the lifetime of the tool. The 17 1/2 pilot hole section commenced at 216m, and was drilled with a SG Gel-Mud. As mentioned above the prime objective of the logging service was to distinguish whether gas sands were present, and a few interesting features must be noted. When drilling the 7/8 pilot hole possible gas sand was logged at 274m, with resistivity response of ohm-m. The 17 1/2 pilot hole section was drilled several days later and thus the already drilled formation down to 370m had been opposed to mud invasion. When relogging the section the resistivity spike at 273m was confirmed, but did not clearly identify the presence of gas. The sand stringer in question indicated now that the formation fluid was water. The sand had probably been invaded by the conductive mud, and gave more typical thin bed response where low resistivity spike is followed by high resistivity spike. The following high resistivity might also have been a shoulder bed effect. Other thin bed responses can be seen at 340m and 525m The sand stringer at 478-479m gave doubtful resistivity response, the peak might indicate gas, but it could also be that the sand is harder at the bottom. The ROP was at all times controlled and does not quite reflect the formation changes. The Saga Geologists at the site did not fully exclude the possibilities of the presence of shallow gas, but no positive gas horizons were seen on the MWD log. No significant gas peaks were recorded by Geoservices, but this might be due to approximately SG overbalance in mudweight, when comparing to the calculated pore-pressure. The separation of the two resistivity curves in the clay sequences are due the dielectric constants of the formations. The tool's memory was downloaded and an excellent RWD log was produced and given to Saga. -2-S  Four bit runs were required to complete the hole section, and all assemblies comprised of the same Teleco RGD tool. separate set of wireline logs were run at section TD, and number of sidewall core samples were taken. The RGD-RAW tool (S/N 8414-5) performed to specification throughout the section. high data density MWD log was recorded, and given to the Saga representatives. The log gave clear picture of the formation changes, and correlated excellent to wireline logs taken in the offset well. Drilled out the 20 casing shoe with pendulum assembly, with the Teleco MWD tool placed 1.69m behind the bit. Prior to penetrating the shoe the hole had been displaced to SG KCL mud, and accordingly the gamma ray trace on the log had to be corrected for the potassium content in the mud. LOT was taken and the pressure obtained in the formation below the shoe was sufficient to commence drilling. The log confirmed the casing shoe depth at 1030m, and the 26 rathole down to 1045m which are reflected by the lower gamma and resistivity values. Drilled through the Hordaland formation with controlled rate of penetration of 20-30 m/hr through the predominant claystone lithology, and with drillbreaks up to 50 m/hr in the occasional sand and sandstone layers. Traces of Limestone were seen in the cuttings, but the thin stringers were not picked up by the MWD 16 Short Normal resistivity device. The Balder formation was encountered at 1925m, and can be seen on the log by gradual declining gamma and an increasing resistivity trend. From 1963m the gamma values rose steadily and marked the transition into the Sele formation at 1975m, where the gamma ray levelled at 50-60 MWD-API. The resistivity trace on the log didn't clearly identify this transition, but stabilized at lower level around ohm-m (R corr). Drilled down to prognosed 2050m with no major problems. Tight holes were encountered in sections due to the hydrating properties of the Claystone. Borehole diameter and mud resistivity corrections have been applied to the resistivity (R corr) trace on the log. Under the present logging conditions the factors applied are just under the acceptable limits for the type of tool in use, causing the large separation between corr and app due to the high salinity of the mud. -3-For this section Modular tool No. 866-40 was utilized. This is field test of an 1/4 triple combination tool. This tool measures and transmit Neutron Porosity and Formation Density in addition to the normal services the DPR tool gives. The hole was logged with wireline after the drilling was completed. Included in the well report are DPR logs only. At the time of performing this field test algorithms for an 8 1/4 Neutron Porosity and Density tool were not available. Porosity logs are calculated in Connecticut and will be given to Saga later. After hours the tool was partially plugged, and stopped transmitting realtime data. Drilling continued, and after about 70m the tool started transmitting again. The pulses were very small but very good realtime log was obtained. The missing sequence was relogged during wiper trip, and realtime log was produced for the hole section. The memory log was recorded during the missing transmission as the turbine was working. Therefore memory log was obtained for the hole section, and presented to the customer. This section was drilled with SG. KCL-mud. The KCL content was kept at around 40 ppb. During drilling the ROP varied between - 30 m/hr which gave an excellent realtime and memory log. While Drilling no significant problems could be notified, which could have effected the logging of the formation by the Teleco MWD tool. -4-TEL BOTTOM HOLE ASSEMBLY RECORDSIIIIIIIIII BHA RECORD + + + + + !SECTION + OD ID LENGTH COMMENTS BIT # 7/8 0.26m HTC ATJIS, 3x20 BIT SUB W/FLOAT 7/8 1.16m SAVER SUB 13/16 0.80m TELECO S/N 8000-047S MONEL 15/16 3u 8.68m DC 11 3u 100.74m JAR 3/4 3u 9.77m DC 3u 27.52m X/0 7/8 3u 1.03m HWDP 3/8 3u 9.08m TELECO RUN # TOTAL BHA 171.91m + + + + + + SECTION ID LENGTH COMMENTS + + + BIT # 1RR1 7/8 0.26m HTC ATJIS, 3x20 TOTAL BHA 171.76mTELECO IIIIIIIININ BRA RECORD o, + + + + + !SECTION OD ID LENGTH COMMENTS BIT # 2RR1 HOLEOPENER 26 36 0.62m 2.72m SMITH DGJC, 3x22,1x24 BIT SUB W/FLOAT 5/16 1.27m X/0 1/2 3/4 1.02m MONEL 15/16 8.68m DC 12 311 109.80m X/0 7/8 7/8 1.03m HWDP 3/8 9.08m HWDP 3/16 311 82.17m  TELECO RUN # TOTAL BHA 230.59m + SECTION + BIT + + 17 OD 1/2 + + ID + LENGTH + 0.43m + COMMENTS + REED MS13G, + + lx17,3x22 X/0 1/4 0.51m DC 30/32 7/8 9.24m X/0 0.83m DC 12 109.80m JAR 3/4 9.77m DC & X/0 28.55m HWDP & DART SUB 3/8 9.76m HWDP 3/16 82.17m TOTAL BHA 280.80mTEL E= IIIIIINNIN + + + + 'SECTION OD ID LENGTH COMMENTS + + BIT SUB W/FLOAT 5/16 0.74m DC 13 119.04m DC 27.52m TOTAL BHA 273.98m + + + SECTION + BIT # + + 17 OD 1/2 + + ID + LENGTH + 0.42m + + COMMENTS + + HTC MAXG3,1x16,3x18 NB STAB W/FLOAT 17 1/2 1/16 1.86m X/0 1/2 1.02m STAB 17 1/2 7/8 1.58m DC 7/8 18.48m DC 12 109.68m TOTAL BHA 288.55m + + + +MIIIIIIIIIIII fio BIT # NAVI DRILL X/0 W/FLOAT 17 1/4 STAB NM P/P SUB MWD SAVER SUB 16 1/2 STAB MONEL DC JAR X/0 HWDP DART SUB TOTAL BHA + + 17 11 OD 1/2 1/4 + ID 9 1/2 9 1/2 3/4 8 1/8 3/4 8 1/4 8 13/16 7 15/16 8 7/8 7 3/4 7 7/8 7/8 6 3/8 6 11/16 13/16 6 3/16 LENGTH 0.42m 11.06m 0.79m 1.17m + COMMENTS + HTC MAXG3,4x20 MK II 1.17m W/TOTCO 8.68m 82.23m 9.77m 27.52m 1.03m 9.08m 0.68m 82.17m 249.21m + + + + BIT # 6RR1 BIT SUB W/FLOAT 17 15/32 STAB DC 14 17 OD 1/2 + ID 9 5/16 8 1/4 3/4 7 15/16 1/6 6 11/32 13/16 LENGTH COMMENTS 0.74m 1.55m 128.16m 283.07m 4,TELECO!
