This report presents the results from wax study on the separator sample from well 30/9-13S. 30/9-13S : Test Bottle no. A4158 Sep.temperature : C Sep.pressure bar Date 15.09.91 2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND INSTRUMENTATION. This wax study includes the following methods; experimental wax equilibrium content by use of ultrasentrifuge, measurement of wax appearance/disappearance temperature (WAT/WDT) and gas chromatographic analysis to determine the paraffin content from C9 to n- C46' The WAT/WDT measurement was performed at Statoil, Prolab. Preparation of sample. Before transfer for analysis the sample was heated to 80C at atmospheric pressure, in order to avoid any loss of heavy components. Experimental wax equilibrium content, by use of ultra centrifuge. Equipment: - Beckman L8-70 ultracentrifuge with 45Ti. rotor. Conditions: - rpm., for 16 hours. The experiments were carried out at 5C, 10C, 20C, 30C and 40C, and for each temperature two parallels were analyzed. The precipitate was weighted before analysis on high- temperature gas chromatograph (the conditions are given on page 4). The GC analysis was done in order to calculate the amount of co-precipitated oil. The corrected amount of wax is given as weight% of total oil, Table 1. gsv120292Wax appearance/ disappearance temperature. Equipment: - Leitz Laborlux 12 microscope with polarization- filter and 32 objective. - Mettler hot stage and control unit (FP80). Conditions: - sample thickness 50 pm. - the sample was heated to 70C, and after 10 minutes the sample was cooled at rate of 0.5C/min. One drop of oil was placed on glass slide with cover glass on top. The wax precipitation temperature (WAT) is reported as the temperature at which the first wax crystals could be observed, Stable 1. Wax disappearance temperature (WDT) was measured by heating the same sample at the same rate (0.5C/min) until the last crystals disappeared, table 3. Gaschromatographic analysis: Equipment: - HP5890 high temperature gas chromatograph. Conditions: - column; 25 capillary CP-sil PAH-CB, ID mm, phase thickness pm. - carrier gas; hydrogen. - temperature prgm; from 45C to 365C with 66/min. - flow constant. - detector: FID The wax-precipitate was diluted in cyclohexane before analysis on GC. To compensate for any column bleeding blank run is subtracted from the chromatogram.II 3.RESULTS. 1& HYDRO TABLE 1. Weight% wax, by ultra centrifuge technique, 30/9-13S - TABLE 2.

The results from the ultra-sentrifuge analysis are given in Table 1 and Fig. 1. For further comparison with other oils see report Vokslikevekter, K. E. Grung et.al; 1991, R-048382. Figure gives the gas chromatogram of total precipitation from ultra sentrifuge analysis at 5C, i.e. wax including co- precipitated oil. The wax is represented by the last part of the chromatogram i.e.mainly where the n-paraffins starts to increase. For the sample at 5C (fig.2) this means that co-precipitated oil is represented by the area up to n-C21 while wax is in the area above n-C21. The other chromatograms from centrifuge analysis at 10C, 20C, 4,30C and 40C are given in Appendix. The results based on microscopy show that for the 30/9-13S sample, the first wax crystal appeared at 35.1C (WAT) and disappeared at 46.0C (WDT), Table 3. The plot of wax content vs temperature from the centrifuge- experiment (Fig. 1) show high concentrations of wax at low temperatures and gave no indication of wax at 40C. This can be explained by the n-paraffin distribution of the crude oil (table 2). The content of paraffins from C10 - C15 is relatively low, compared to other North Sea oils. There is also relatively low concentration of long-chain n-paraffins. 5. CONCLUSION. The wax precipitation of the separator oil from test of well 39/9-13S is supposed to start around 35 C. The wax amount at low temperature is relatively high, and the amount of long-chain paraffins is low, and the wax precipitation at high temperatures is also low. All measurements have been undertaken under static conditions.ISEHYDRO ;41, Ukt 1YD  PL1 Analysis Name [PVT] 11 300913SVOKS,4,1.
