Box 72 Stavanger, Norway Attention: Mr. P. W. Reynolds Subject: Reservoir Fluid Studies 2/4-4AX Well DST Nos. and Ekofisk Field North Sea, Norway Our File Numbers: RFL 6653 and RFL 6654 Gentlemen: Samples of separator liquid and vapor collected during DST No. and DST No. were submitted to our laboratory in Dallas for use in reservoir fluid studies. Presented on the following pages are the results of these studies as requested by Phillips Petroleum Company - Norway. After correction for the gas gravity and supercompressibility factors, the separator gas -liquid ratio during DST No. was calculated to be 1222 standard cubic feet of separator gas per barrel of separator liquid at 570 psig and 74 F. This ratio was used in conjunction with the measured compositions of the separator products to calculate the composition of the well stream material. The separator products were then physically re- combined in this producing gas ..liquid ratio and the bubble point pressure of this resulting fluid was measured to be 5886 psig at the reservoir temperature of 266 F. The results of the tests that were performed using these sepa- rator products are presented on pages one through four of the report. The producing gas-liquid ratio during DST No. was calculated to be 1703 standard cubic feet of separator gas per barrel of separator liquid. AfterPhillips Petroleum Company - Norway Page Two 2/4-4AX Well, DST Nos. and physically recombining the separator products to this producing gas -liquid ratio the resulting fluid was determined to have bubble point pressure of 6228 psig at 258 F. The results of the tests performed on these samples are presented on pages five through eight of the report. A preliminary report issued November 4, 1970 contained the results of hydrocarbon analyses :of the separator products, the calculated well stream compositions and the bubble point pressure of each mixture at reservoir temperature. At that time we were requested to hold all remaining gas and liquid samples collected during these tests until these preliminary data had been fully analyzed by Phillips Petroleum Company - Norway. On February 12, 1971 we were instructed by telex that no further testing would be required using these samples, and that any remaining gas and liquid samples could be discarded at this time. As always, it has been our pleasure to cooperate with Phillips Petroleum Company - Norway in performing these studies. If you have any questions regarding these data, please do not hesitate to contact us. Very truly yours, Core Laboratories, Inc. Reservoir Fluid Analysis PLM:I-IS:d1 P. L. Moses ManagerDALLAS.
