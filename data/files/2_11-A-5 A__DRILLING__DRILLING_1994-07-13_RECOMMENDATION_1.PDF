The 2/11-10ST2 is encouraging because it demonstrated that porosity zones within the Chalk can be mapped using amplitude v.s. offset (AVO) analysis, seismic inversion, and phase reversal indicators. Oil was also present within the thickened porous zone as predicted. Pressures were not depleted indicating that the porous pod is separated from Hod Field as originally predicted by the stratigraphic trap model. Prediction and mapping of porous intervals within the Chalk using advanced seismic techniques is now possible, and for that reason the 2/11-10ST2 is considered technological success. On the other hand, the well has been disappointing as producer. . Results from the 2/11-10ST2 well indicate that 23m of net pay are present within the Tor A with 37.7% average porosity and 35.9% average water saturation. Core from the reservoir interval shows high oil saturations down to depth of 3917 (2830 TVD) where an abrupt facies change occurs. Porous reworked Tor is present above the contact and a hardground with low porosity and permeability (Tor B) is present below the contact. Both logs and core indicate that no water leg or transition zone is present within the 2/11- IOST2 well. Production testing of the well, however, has yielded rates of approximately 522 BOPD (83 SM3) and 346 BWPD (55 SM3). As the well continued to flow water cuts increased to approximately 50%. Core and log data are inconsistent with these high water cuts indicating that natural fracture system may be bringing water into the wellbore from along strike and below the regional oil/water contact. Fluids from the stimulation and frac may have broken into the fault related fracture system mapped by 3-D seismic data just north of the wellbore. . . The Tor reservoir in the 2/11-10ST2 well is overlain by 9th tvd of less permeable Ekofisk. The Ekofisk has higher water saturations and lower permeabilities than the Tor A reservoir. The Ekofisk is not expected to contribute significantly to the reserves. Row meter testing of the perfs in the well indicate that the upper perfs (extending into the Ekofisk) are not contributing any flow into the wellbore. The fluid is coming predominately from the second set of perfs (60%) with 40% coming from.the lower two sets of pens. Most of the water is believed to be coming from the two lower perforations. The horizontal wellpath for the 2/11-A5A has been designed to test the ihickest portion (16m-22m) of the Tor reservoir updip from the 2/11- IOST2 wellbore and away from any faults that may bring in water. The wellbore is also located within the area of strongest phase reversal from the reflector at the Top Chalk. This phase reversal has been calibrated with the 2/11-10ST2 well data and is believed to indicate maximum porosity within the reservoir. The horizontal wellbore should yield higher rates with less water cut than the original well.DRILLING PROGRAMME INPUT 2/11-A-SA 3. GEOPHYSICAL DISCUSSION Seismic Data Oualit, The geophysical mapping which defines the prospectivity to be tested by the 2/11-A-5A well, is based on the Rita 3D seismic survey, acquired in1990 with final processing completed in February 1992. The seismic data quality at chalk level shows considerable variation over the survey area, but can generally be considered good, with the exception of the 'gas cloud' affected area associated with central West Hod. Some wavelet shaping has been applied to the data during standard bulk processing and wavelet extraction work carried out prior to seismic inversion suggests that the wavelet is reasonably symmetrical, and for practical purposes can be considered zerophase. Horizon identification Synthetic seismogram ties at East Hod are generally good, with top and base chalk unambiguously calibrated at most wells. Over the survey area as whole, and with the exception of the key areas of porosity development (cratal East Hod / Hod Pod area), the Palaeocene shale/ chalk boundary represents significant increase in seismic impedance and therefore results in high amplitude seismic trough. This is characterised best by the 2/11-3 well. By contrast, the 2/11A-2ST2 well lies centrally in the area of optimal upper chalk porosity development, where the transition from Palaeocene shale to chalk represents an impedance decrease, due to the lower density and seismic velocity associated with the highly porous chalk. The top chalk seismic reflector at this location is therefore represented by strong seismic peak The extremes of seismic amplitude and porosity observed in these wells, illustrate the clear link between seismic polarity / amplitude and chalk reservoir quality in the Hod Field area. Seismic calibration from the VSP at the V11-10 well, confirms the top chalk (top Ekofisk) to be associated with an intermediate strength seismic peak, indicating an impedance decrease at the shale / chalk boundary. Thus the lateral extent where this reflector has comparable peak amplitude to that of the 2/11-10 well control, is potentially representative of the upper chalk porosities encountered at the well. Thus over the area to be drained by the proposed horizontal sidetrack of 2111-10 S, the top of the porous chalk (top Ekofisk) is defined as seismic peak. The base of the porous zone (base Tor A) is associated with the lower zero-crossing of the adjacent high amplitude through, (as shown in the seismic illustration in figure A). Target Definition Figure shows the isopach mapping based on the above seismic calibration, superimposed on the top chalk structural surface. The colour filled contours represent the total vertical thickness (metres) of the upper porous chalk section (top Ekofisk- base Tor A) as defmed by the 2/11-10 well. This shows maximum of approximately 35 at the depocentre. Also shown, is the limit of the 'phase reversal'area; i.e. where the top chalk seismic amplitude ranges from seismic peak through to zero-crossing, and thus following the logic presented above, is likely to represent porous upper chalk. In addition, the limits on seismic resolution at this depth suggest that where this polarity reversed top surface is definable, minimum reservoir thickness of approximately 20m is implied. Below this thickness destructive interference from the underlying, higher absolute amplitude, seismic trough will mask the reflectivity from the porous chalk, if present. This combination of phase- reversal and isopach mapping supports the case for separation of this down-flank reservoir from the currently producing crestal East Hod reservoir. Figure shows seismic section coincident with the proposed 2/11-A-5A well path (shown in figure B). This shows the entire horizontal section to lie within the top chalk polarity reversed area, with the reservoir penetration point lying close to the southern limit. It can be seen from the seismic that both the thickness and porosity are likely to increase significantly over the first 200m of the (overall 1000m) horizontal section. In locating.the proposed sidetrack, and attempt has been made to avoid faulting of sufficient magnitude to either provide possible communication to water, zones via fault induced fractures, or to cause difficulties in steering the horizontal section. The seismic section shows this to have been largely achievable, although there is clearly remaining potential for small scale faulting along the well-bore.P;14 ro;vt Fie Functions 99tions Selections Ii 2675 - 2758 - 2825 - 2850 - I paleocene 37 t chalic 37 2875 - 2925 - 2950 - outniitiwommumni Function: Draw Help C Pko St ge erscd 11.

Critical information will be obtained on what to expect from the effects of diagenesis, fracture density, and matrix permeability on reservoir performance.  Critical information resolving the disparity between well performance in the 2/11-10 and log and core properties will be obtained. Resolving this is key to making the right decisions on evaluating future prospects.  Key information will be obtained on the relationship between structural position, degree of structural complexity, faulting and trap geometry that will strongly influence how and where we drill wells into future prospects. 21Ia5a5Strategic Factors (cont.) Critical information will be obtained for the assessment of the Mjcid prospect located just six kilometers east of Valhall. Mj0d has the potential for 90 MMBO recoverable reserves which would significantly impact the management of the Valhall asset. Knowing how and where to drill Mj0d, how to test and complete it and what differences and similarities to expect in the way of reservoir performance is critical to successful evaluation of that prospect and to the overall Chalk Stratigraphic Play. Key information obtained from the horizontal well increases the efficiency of the staff working the project. The partnership is preparing to dedicate significant amount of manpower to the Chalk play and results from the horizontal well will replace allot of interpretive conclusions with hard facts. 211a5a5.doc Key Refinement To The Exploration Model .

It is understood that the NPD had reservations on the limited evaluation programme for this well, as did one of the partners, given its geological modelling importance for future potential chalk plays within the Valhall catchment area. In response to this Gabe was asked to suggest an additional programme which was circulated to members in Exploration and Resource Management. Helge Restad and myself were asked to cost this programme which we did, and the results were once again widely distributed to members of both departments and to members of the drilling dept. The programme was faxed to partners on Saturday July 30th. Unfortunately this seems to have been done without sufficient communication between team players who have important contributions to make to such decision, and as such has caused some internal concern. The aim of this cornmuncation is to try to establish common understanding and logic to the proposed programme given that partners and NPD are likely, and seem to be already, phoning many of the Hod Team members Both Chris William's and Cathy Farmer, the two key persons involved in this project, are away for the next two weeks. Rick D'Angelo, Gabe Artigas and myself have tried to think through the logic and possibilities behind the proposed pipe conveyed programme and the results have been outlined on the decision tree shown in figure 1. Assuming that the additional logging programme has been recommended on the basis of results shown by the FEMWD and the cost position at TD (and only Chris William's and Cathy can answer this), then this diagranune shows that the probability of running the additional pipe conveyed logs is around 59%, (with contingency full pipe conveyed programme of about 4%). Thus it can be seen that the total probability of running the proposed pipe conveyed logging suite is in the order of 63%, (4% of this probability includes full pipe conveyed logging programme in the event of total failure of FEMWD logs). The reasons for running these extra logs have been outlined in figure 2. The dominant reason is for open fracture identification and geological modelling, although there are some additional spin-off benefits that will be gained if these tools are run.

Killing of well performed prior to skidding the rig 2. Reuse of entire completion string (SCSSV, tubing, etc.) 3. Completion based on sets of perforation intervals. 4. Stimulation of well. 5. No wireline or pipeconveyed logs to be runned. 6. No coring. 7. Based on rig availability and preliminary rate Suction presented by Mrersk. Final negotiation with Marsk Thursday the 14th.

ANOC Well 2/11-A-5A 8-1/2 Sidetrack To TO (includes 1000 Horizontal Section) Qualitative Risk Appraisal Design Point Potential Trouble Time Source Operational Consequences 1. Drill 8-1/2 Hole From Packetock Kickoff Inside 9-5/8' cog to TD. Differential sticking In horizontal chalk section while required maintenance of mud weight necessary to keep tertiary shales balanced (wellbore stability) Lose wellbore. Evaluate possibility to sidetrack in horizontal section? Ability to run and effectively cement/Isolate pay with long 7' liner (3300 m). Poor to no zonal isolation in horizontal profile. Longer open hole section provides more opportunity for sticking casing off bottom. Fishing stuck casing or evaluation of 5' liner options (alternate completion strategy). Torque/drag profile approaching design limits of TDDS due to unknown FF effects in long open hole section hole Have to set 7' liner to reduce torque/drag to acceptable level to reach TD in 8' hole size. 2. Use of 8' contingency hole section should casing be required at top chalk. No use of Neutron/Density logging tool to aid in Geoeteering. Limitations on 3-1/2 drill string required to drill horizontal section (flow rate). No ability to run concentric completion string (7 by 5' liners). Reduce tubing size options for completion Limitations on ability to provide zonal isolation: cementing long 5' liner, no ability to use external casing packers. Density/Neutron logging would have to be run on DP conveyed tools. Addftbnal days rig time to do so. Operational reliability of 4-3/4 MWD (GR-RES) for Geosteedng resulting in additional time to change out tool. Time/cost requirements to change out drill string to drill 11* hole12-1/4 (9-5/8 Csg) 8-1/2 Sidetrack To TD (includes 1000 Horizontal Section) 1. Initiate sidetrack from cement plug Poor cement plug Set second cement plug to sidetrack 2. Selection of 9-5/86 casing point To shallow set depth Leave part of tertiary shale section exposed, creating wellbore instability situation? Extra backreaming required. Operational Benefits 1. Increased contingency options in the event of hole problems to allow reaching wellbore objectives. 2. Use of standard tubular & completion design (ability to run concentric completion) 3. Use of standardized MWD string (6-1/26 vs. 4-3/46), including Density/Neutron. 4. Torque/drag profile optimized by use of intermediate casing string, thus maximizing chances of reach TD objective. 5. Ability to lower mud weight as required in horizontal section without effecting wellbore stability due to intermediate hole being cased off. 6. Hole geometries have been tested/utilized in Valhall and have proven' track record off operational success.COSTEST1.)0.S MARSK GIANT OPERATIONAL SEQUENCE 12 /4 HOLESECTION TO TOP OF CHALK FORMATION AND /2 TO TD): SEQ.NO.
