PALYNOLOGY OF SELECTED INTERVALS OF THE NORSK HYDRO 30/9 - 13 AND 30/9 - 13 SX WELLS, NORWAY by N.S. IOANNIDES EREP.09WA.92 NOVEMBRE 92I N.S. Ioannides INTRODUCTION This report discusses the results combined from analyses of core and sidewall core samples obtained on loan from Norsk Hydro and performed here and those presented in report by RRI. Emphasis is placed on our analyses whereas RRI's data are used on complementary basis -intervals of poor recoveries or without palynological samples available. Comparisons with other wells in the same black (e.g. 30/9-1, 30/9-5) has not been possible as the existing data lack recently described species used in this study. Designation of the well numbers was supplied by Norsk Hydro to RRI as follows : Well 30/9 - 13 was drilled to depth of 3031 and subsequently plugged back to 2890 m. The well was then sidetracked at 2894 after having set casing at 2878 m. Norsk Hydro requested that the plugged part of the well from 2894 to 3031 is designated the 30/9 - 13 SX and the hole above 2894 m and the sidetracked one to be referred to as 30/9 - 13 S.

BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC SUMMARY 30/9 - 13 2952 : Early Callovian (RRI) - 2955 : Early Callovian (RRI), Calloviense - Macrocephalus zones - 2957 - (C) : Early Callovian, probably Macrocepha7us zone - 1959.5 (C) : Late Bathonian, Discus ? zone 2960 (C) : Late - Middle Bathonian, Hodsoni-Subcontractus zones, probably Hodsoni proximity - 2963.9 (C) & (C) Middle - Early Bathonian - 3, Progracilis - Tenuip7icatus zones ? 2969 (Cores) : Early Bathonian, Tenuiplicatus - Zigzac zones - 3091 - 3100 (Cores) : Bajocian ? - (Middle - Early ?, RRI) 3105 25 - 3187 (Cores) : Bajocian - (Middle - Early Bajocian, RRI) 3187 (C) - 3375 : Bajocian - (Middle Early Bajocian, RRI) 3375 3450 : Early Bajocian - down to 3470 ; RRI extend this age 3470 : Late Toarcian (RRI) 3480 (S) : Late Toarcian -3. 30/9 - 13 SX 2944 (S) : Oxfordian - Late Callovian, Pseudocordata - Athleta zones - 2947 (S) - 2951 (S) : Callovian, probably low 2951 (S) & 2952 : Early Callovian, Calloviense - Macrocephalus zones - 2955 : See text 2969 (S) Middle - Early Bathonian - 2974 3004 (SWC's) : Low Middle - Early Bathonian - Discussion : Numerous Verneuilinoides suggest Middle Jurassic. The Early Callovian age is confined by the underlying assemblages. Discussion : Nannoceratopsis spicu7ata and Chytroeisphaeridia hyalina confirm the above age. 2957 - (C) : Early Callovian, probably Macrocephalus Discussion : Several Nannoceratopsis pellucida, frequent Sirmiodinium grossii, C. hyalina and Pareodinia 'oriata', in association, favour the assigned age.4. 2959.5 (C) Late Bathonian, Discus ? zone (basal Callovian not entirely excluded) - Discussion : S. grossii continues to be fairly frequent, together with rare Quadraeculina anellaeformis and dubious records of Gonyau7acysta pectinigera. The report by RRI of numerous Pareodinia evittia from about the same level (2957.7 m) supports similar age range. Environment : Collectively, the richness of amorphous kerogen recovered from the above interval (2952 - m) indicates reducing depositional conditions. Late - Middle Bathonian, Hodsoni - Subcontractus zones (RRI), probably Hodsoni proximity - Discussion : Reported species by RRI include abundant Ctenidodinium gochtii together with Crussolia perireticulata, Sirmiodinium grossii, Nannoceratopsis pellucida and Pareodinia brachythelis. Abundant C.gochtii are not known above the ammonite age range given above whereas S. grossii is arguably restricted to Discus and younger. However, this unusual co-occurrence has also been reported from coeval strata in the British sector of the northern North Sea. Remarks : From 2960 to 3021 all data are objtained from RRI's report and here re-interpreted whenever necessary. The two samples provided by Norsk Hydro from this interval (2980.35 & 3009 m) have yielded little or no information. 2963.9 (C) & (C) Middle - Early Bathonian - Progracilis - Tenuiplicatus zones ? Discussion : The first down hole appearance of Dissiliodinium willei is tentatively considered to occur low in mid-Bathonian. The environmental implications of this top are discussed later in this report. The additional presence of Parvocysta sp. of Bjaerke and abundant specimens referable by RRI to Escharisphaeridia (probably Dissiliodinium complex seen in large numbers, in British northern North Sea, in similarly dated rocks).5. 2969 - (all cores) Early Bathonian, Tenuiplicatus - Zigzac Discussion : D. willei is reported in abundance from 2969 by RRI. Therefrom and down to the base of the interval, successive occurrences of low diversity, essentially monospecific and poorly preserved (fragmented specimens) assemblages are reported (RRI) or observed. D. willei or variants re-occur as well as influxes of Diacanthum filapicatum, and Gongylodinium sp. This type of restricted dinocyst assemblages have been frequently encountered in coeval rocks in the British North Sea. Environment : Low diversity and monospecific populations intermittently found in sequence and intercalated with barren intervals are usually characteristic of shallow to marginal marine environments. High energy conditions and continuous sorting are often the cause of fragmentation. As result of these conditions the true top of the recorded species may not be seen or even the very same species (and older species) may be reworked and their ranges modified. The latter case may or may not be responsible for some of the records of species discussed in the interval below. 3091.5 3100 (cores) : Bajocian ? - (Middle - Early ?, RRI) Discussion : Increase of land-derived palynomorphs and absence of marine elements seen above. Cyathidites spp., Cerebropollenites mesozoicus, bisaccate pollen, Botryococcus (fresh water) are present to dominant. Occasional acritarchs (near shore), and rare Nannoceratopsis senex and N. gracilis are seen in top sample. If the latter two species are not introduced through recycling, the above association as whole would indicate penetration of the Bajocian, RRI favour pre-late Bajocian age on the abundance of Exesipollenites spp. at 3091.5 m. In the Norsk Hydro sample from same level we have not observed the abundance indicated by RRI.6. 3105.25 - 3187 (cores) : Bajocian - (Middle - Early Bajocian, RRI) Discussion : RRI report N. gracilis and N. senex from and Chasmatosporites hians from m. We have observed these species in Norsk Hydro's slides at 3129 and below. A Bajocian age is suggested, possibly Late to Middle Bajocian. Remarks : The core sample at 3187 is the last sample available for our study. The information given for the remaining section is based on data derived from RRI's report (cuttings samples). 3187 (C) - 3375 : Bajocian - (Middle - Early Bajocian, RRI) Discussion : Land - derived palynomorphs including C. hians and the marine N. grad/is and N. senex are persistent but rare. 3375 - 3450 Early Bajocian - ; RRI extend this age down to 3470 but no range charts are provided from this interval in order to verify the occurences. Discussion : Obvious increase of N. gracilis and the appearance of N. ambonis and Wallodinium elongatum. Terrestrially derived spores and pollen continue to be dominant with C. hians persistent and often numerous. Remarks : The assemblage cited above may range into the Late Aalenian. number of markers established during our Brent study are not reported by RRI and it is difficult to confine the age for certain to either stage. However, the terrestrial palynomorph fraction is more consistent with known Bajocian assemblages. 3470 Late Toarcian (RRI) Discussion : This top is based on micropalaeontology (species unknown to us).7. Discussion : The first SWC that yielded palynomorphs of Late Toarcian (Levesquei zone) age was taken at this level. 2944 (S) : Oxfordian - Late Callovian, Pseudocordata-Athleta zones - Discussion : The age is based on the combined occurrence of Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Stephanelytron redcliffense, Scriniodinium crystallinum. Remarks : RRR report from same level E. gochtii ; this species excludes the basal Kimmeridgian Bay/el zone. Discussion : Pareodinia evittii, Gonyau7acysta jurassica, Sirmiodinium grossii, Ctenidodinium continuum, C. gochtii gr. and Rigaudella aemu7a support the above assignment. 2951 (S) & 2952 : Early Callovian, Calloviense - Nacrocephalus Discussion : The presence of several Sirmiodinium grossii together with Bombyxiella sp. at 2951 indicates the above age range. In addition RRI provide corroborative evidence with numerous Chytroeisphaeridia hya7ina from 2952 m,I 8. Remarks : Contradictory evidence is obtained from SWC and cuttings sample from same level (2955 m). Either the depth assigned to the SWC is erroneous (as suggested by Robertson) or mainly caved material is recovered from the cuttings. The ages of the two samples are as follows : 2955 (SWC, N. Hydro) : Bathonian, Hodsoni-Subcontractus zones 2955 (cuttings, RRI) : Early Callovian, not older than Macrocepha7us zones 2969 (S) : Middle - Early Bathonian - Discussion  . Rare and fragmented Dissiliodinium willei tentatively suggest the above age assignment. 2979 - 3004 (all SWC) : Low Middle - Early Bathonian - NSI:bp (Novembre 92) Discussion : Frequent to common D. willei and occasional Gongylodinium sp. successively re-occur throughout this interval. Environment : See discussion on same interval in 30/9 - 13 S.
