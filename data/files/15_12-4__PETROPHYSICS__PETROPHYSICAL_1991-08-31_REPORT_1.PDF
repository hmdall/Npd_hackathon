The Oxfordian sands are divided into zones, and average values for net- gross, porosity, water saturation and permeability are calculated for each zone. Logs, core and formation multi-tester data are used in the evaluation. Test data are available in wells 15/12-5 and 6. Log data in 15/12-4 and are of good quality, while there are intervals with poor hole conditions in 15/12-6. In 15/12-6 the cored interval covers the whole Jurassic sand interval, while in 15/12-4 and 5, only the upper part of the sand has been cored. SCAL-data were available only in 15/12-5 at the time of the evaluation. Porosities are generally estimated from density logs which are calibrated to core data. Sand-curves are defined using cutoffs for porosity and shale volume, and by manually defining cemented layers within the sand. Saturations are calculated by Archie's equation for wells 15/12-4 and -5, and by using Indonesia equation for 15/12-6. Results from the petrophysical evaluation are shown in tables and CPI-log plots included in this document. 2. INTRODUCTION The petrophysical evaluation of wells 15/12-4,5 and is part of study to build the 15/12-Beta-West geological model. The results from the petrophysical evaluation will be used for volumetric calculations and as input data for reservoar simulation. The 15/12-Beta-West reservoar lies within good quality late Jurassic (Oxfordian) sandstone. high degree of faulting divides the stucture into at least three segments with different pressures. In parallel with the petrophysical evaluation, new seismic interpretation is done, and new geological model is built, in which the Oxfordian sandstones are divided into nine units. A previous petrophysical evaluation of the three wells has been performed following well completion, and separate reports of these evaluations exist. For 15/12-6 the calculated curves from the previous evaluation have been used unchanged. In addition, overburden corrections are made for the core data, and permeabilities are calculated as well. For 15/12-4 and -5 new evaluation is performed. However, FMT-pressure data and temperatures are taken from the previousevaluation done in these wells after rough quality check to validate these. 3.

Tables 3.1.3.a, and give an overview of cores and plugs in the evaluation interval of the wells. Depth shifts are also listed. The depth intervals specified are prior to depth shifting. Routine core analysis has been done for all three wells. SCAL- analysis has been performed for wells 15/12-5 and.-6. However, at the time of the evaluation SCAL-data were available only in 15/12-5.

FMT logs are run in all three wells, and pressure readings are obtained from strain gauge in 15/12-4 and from HP Crystal gauge in 15/12-5 and -6. A summary of the data is given in the Petropysical Evaluation reports for each wells (reference list /1/,/2/ and /3/) and in fig. 1. 3.1.5 Test data Wells 15/12-5 and -6 have been tested. See own reports for test results (reference list /4/ and /5/).3.2.1 Computer system The evaluations of wells 15/12-4 and -5 were performed on the SFINX system. The main part of the evaluation of 15/12-6 was performed using the WDS (Well Data System) system, and raw and evaluation curves were subsequently transferred to SFINX for final processing. 3.2.2 Environmental corrections For 15/12-4 and -5 the resistivity curves have been environmentally corrected prior to analysis. For 15/12-6 all curves used in evaluation have been corrected. 3.2.3 Depth shifting of logs and core data Depth shifting of logs on 15/12-6 has been done by comparing Gamma ray curves from the different runs. Logs for wells 15/12-4 and -5 have not been depth shifted. Core data have been shifted as shown in tables 3.1.3 a, and c. constant average shift has been used to simplify the data preparation, even though the automatic depth shift routine of the WDS system gives slightly better correlation if varying depth shift is used within the same core. 3.2.4 Zonation The Jurassic (Oxfordian) sandstones have been divided into two main sub-units. The upper unit has been divided into zones (US1 to US6), and the aower unit into zones (LS1 to LS3). Table 3.2.4 lists the zone depth intervals for each well.Table 3.2.4 Depth interval, meter, MD RKB Heather 2 8 0 US1 0 5 US2 1 5 US3 9 2955 - US5 8 6 2878.6- 2900 US6 7 2 9 LS1 9 6 2919 - LS2 8 2931.5- 2938 LS3 4 9 3.2.5 Evaluation parameters Table 3.2.5 lists Rw, a, in and parameters used in the evaluation. Table 3.2.5 Rw (ohmm) in 15/12-4 15/12-5 15/12-6 a, and n-values are taken from SCAL-analysis in well 15/12- 5. Rw is estimated from logs and pressure gradients for the three wells. 3.2.6 Pressure Evaluation of FMT-pressure data indicates three differentpressure regimes for the three wells. Reference is made to Petrophysical Evaluation Report for each of the three wells, as well as to fig. 1. 3.2.7 Temperature Temperatures have been estimated from extrapolation of log temperatures and from test data. See table for temperature values. 3.2.8 Overburden corrections Overburden correction factors are calculated from SCAL-data in 15/12-5. Calculation gives an effective reservoir pressure of 274 bar for this well. The overburden pressure is found by taking the integrated density less the fluid pressure from FMT-data. The calculated overburden correction factors are for porosity (fig. 2) and for permeability (fig. 3). These factors are assumed to be valid for all three wells. 3.2.9 Shale volume In 15/12-4 and -5 the shale volume is taken as the minimum of the shale volumes when calculated from the Gamma Ray and from the density/neutron crossplot. In 15/12-6 the shale volume is estimated from the Gamma Ray only. Parameters used in calculation are: Well Interval MD RKB GRMIN API GRMAX API PHINsh frac RHOBsh glee-3.2.10 Net sand In 15/12-4 and -5 cemented stringers have been manually picked and defined as KALK. In addition COAL has been picked manually as well. An interval is defined as net SAND when it is not defined as KALK or COAL, and if the following criteria are met: Shale volume, Vsh < 40% Porosity, PHIF > 12% In 15/12-6 the same cut-off values has been used, except that KALK has not been manually defined. 3.2.11 Porosity The porosity is calculated from the density log for wells 15/12-4 and -5. The relation PHIF = * RHOB + is used. The constants and are estimated from crossplots of overburden corrected core porosity versus log density (RHOB). The regression line is forced through the point (Rhoma,91),where Rhoma is the mean matrix density from core data for each well. Table 3.2.11 shows matrix derisities used, as well as the respective a- and b-constants calculated. Fig. 4,5,6,7 and show the crossplots with regression lines for each zone where core data are available. For zones without core data a- and b-constants have been estimated by extrapolation. For 15/12-6 porosities have also been calculated from the density log, except for washout zones where the sonic log was used (reference list /3/). Table 3.2.11 Well Zone Matrix density 15/12-4 Heather US1 US2-TD 15/12-5 Heather US1-US2 (oil-zone) US2-US3 (water) US4-TD ,3.2.12 Saturations For 15/12-4 and -5 water saturation has been calculated by the Archie equation, and for 15/12-6 by the Indonesia equation. Normally it would be preferable to use the same saturation model for all three wells. However, because of the low shale content in the oil-zones and the high salinity of formation water, the two models will give only minor differences in the calculated saturation values. For 15/12-6 we therefore used the curves from the recent petrophysical evaluation following the well completion. The a, in and n-exponents are taken from SCAL-data in well For use in volumetrics plot of SW versus height above OWC is made. The Sw-curve is visually fitted to the calculated zonal average points.The relationship is assumed to be valid for the whole Beta-West area. (see fig. 27) 3.2.13 Permeability Horisontal permeability (KLOGH) is derived from the log porosity curve (PHIF) by the relation log KLOGH = * PHIF + where the constants and are estimated from crossplots of overburden corrected core permeability versus log porosity. For 15/12-4 and -5, where the sands are only partially cored, relations from corresponding zones in 15/12-6 are used. This represents high degree of uncertainty, but no other methods are found to be more appropriate. Table 3.2.13 lists the estimated and b-values for the various wells and zones of interest. Figs. through 21 show the crossplots. Aritmetic and geometric mean values for each zone are calculated for the porosity-derived permeability. The same is done for horisontal core permeability for the cored zones. These values are listed in Chapter 4, Summary of results.Table 3.2.13 Well Zone Well used to find relation: 15/12-5 Heather US1 US2 US3 15/12-5 It if It 15/12-6 US4 US5 US6 LS1 LS2 LS3 Trias 15/12-6 It iv II II II tl Vertical permeability is estimated from crossplots of KLV vs KLH. linear regression is done for core measurements from wells 15/12-4 and -5. From core analysis values of KLH and KLV down to mD are measured. Tests with different cut-offs show minor dependence on cut-off-value. Consequently, value of mD is used for both KLV and KLH. The KLV/KLH-factor is estimated to 0.835. The KLV/KLH-factor in the 15/12-6 well varies considerably between the upper and the lower sand intervals. The factor has value of in the interval 5 MDRKB, probably do to high degree of fracturing, while it is in the interval 9. For reservoir simulation purposes the factor of is used as an average value for the Beta-West area. 3.2.14 Pore volume compressiblity In 15/12-5 pore volume compressibility has been calculated from SCAL-measurements of pore volume reduction vs net confining pressure from plugs. The average value for pore volume compressibility value from these plugs is 0.693*10-4 /bar.4.

This is mainly due to the fact that the SAND curve is defined by cut-offs applied on log-derived data. Core data have been subjected to constant shift for each core, which for this well may lead to core porosities below cut-off being included in the average calculation5.
