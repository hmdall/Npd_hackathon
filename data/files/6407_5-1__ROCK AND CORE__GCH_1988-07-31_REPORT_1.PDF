The well section analysed is immature from 1030m to approximately 2200m, early mature from 2200m to approximately 3600m, middle mature for oil generation from 3600m to 4100m and late mature from 4100m to 4306mTD. Maturity profiles are essentially continuous with no breaks apparent, and do not indicate significant uplift and erosion of section. The Upper Jurassic slide block within the Aptian of the Cromer Knoll Group does not affect the maturity profiles as maturation took place as result of burial during the later Cretaceous and the Tertiary. No oil source rocks have been identified in the well section analysed. The Cromer Knoll Group, .Lange Formation, in the sample interval 3010m to 3873m, comprises mainly dark shales. These have generally below average total organic carbon contents and have no source potential. Samples representative of the Upper Jurassic slide block have above average total organic carbon contents but contain gas-prone kerogens and have no significant source potential. Within the Viking Group, the mainly dark grey and grey-black argillaceous lithologies of the Spekk Formation in the sample interval 3873m to 4107m exhibit above average and generally good total organic carbon contents. The kerogens are, however, of gas-prone, humic nature, comprising mainly inertinite and vitrinite. Similarly, the Melke Formation in the sample interval 4107m to 4206m consists largely of dark shales and mudstones which have only average total organic carbon contents and contain mainly inertinitic kerogens with subordinate vitrinite. The Viking Group, which is middle to late mature for oil generation, has not generated any oil in attaining the present maturity level. Organically richer intervals in the Spekk Formation may have some gas generation potential which could be realised at higher maturity levels. The analyses of the Spekk and Melke Formations indicate the presence of minor amounts of oil stain, probably derived from more oil-prone, sapropelic kerogen equivalent of the humic dominated Viking Group. Robertson Ilfw-olGroupThe Fangst Group, Can Formation, in the sample interval 4206m to 4306mTD, consists mainly of sandstones which have low total organic carbon contents and have no significant source potential. r/RobertsonSample preparation (cleaning and lithology description) 176 Picking of individual lithologies 27 Total organic carbon content 138 Rock-Eval pyrolysis 51 Solvent extraction 24 Extract fractionation 18 Alkane gas chromatography 14 Kerogen preparation 45 Spore colouration index 45 Vitrinite reflectivity 43 The abbreviations used in the analytical data sheets presented in this report are listed in Appendix and the analytical procedures and techniques employed during the course of the study are described briefly in Appendix 2.

The maturity and kerogen composition data are presented in Table 1(A-G). Spore colouration indices and vitrinite reflectivity are plotted against depth in Figures and respectively. The histograms, data and statistics for vitrinite reflectivity are given in Appendix 3(1-11). Further maturity data have been obtained by the examination of kerogen and whole rock samples in ultra-violet/blue light and the observation of the fluorescence colour of liptinite macerals, by the chromatographic analysis of airspace gaseous (C1-C4) hydrocarbons (Table 4, A-I; Figure 3) and of gasoline range (C4-C7) hydrocarbons (Table 5, A-E; Table 6; Figures to 7), and by the measurement of the temperature of maximum evolution of hydrocarbons (Tmax,.C) on Rock-Eval pyrolysis (Tables and 3, Enclosure 1). The maturity data are summarised in Enclosure 1, the geochemical maturity summary log. The observed maturity indices have been compared with estimations of thermal maturity calculated from the present day bottom hole temperature data (Figure 8) and the time-thickness curve of the 6407/5-1 well (Figure 9). In summary, the 6407/5-1 well section analysed is immature from 1030m to approximately 2200m, early mature from 2200m to approximately 3600m, middle mature for oil generation between 3600m and 4100m and late mature for oil between 4100m and 4306mTD. The spore colouration maturity data are generally of good quality, with sufficient numbers of palynomorphs being observed in each sample for reliable maturity data to be obtained. It is noted that the spore colouration maturity data are indicative of marginally higher maturity levels than is suggested by the analysis of airspace gaseous hydrocarbons and from the vitrinite reflectivity data. Whilst the spore colouration data are generally preferred for the assessment of thermal maturity, the delineation of maturity levels in the well is based on an integration of all of the maturity data available. fitliRobertsonThe transition from immaturity to early maturity at approximately 2200m corresponds to spore colouration index of about 4.0. The definition of the onset of early maturity is rather uncertain. The transition from early to middle maturity with respact to oil generation, which is generally placed at spore colouration index 5.0, is, in the 6407/5-1 well, placed at approximately 3600m, which corresponds to spore colouration index 6.0. This is based on comparison with the vitrinite reflectivity data and primarily in consideration of the airspace gaseous hydrocarbon analysis data. The gaseous hydrocarbons, as described in Section 3.3, show marked increase in the proportion of wet (C2-C4) gaseous components over the interval approximately 3400m to 3600m, combined with gradual decrease in the iso-butane/normal butane ratio over the interval 3000m to 3600m. As with the vitrinite reflectivity maturity profile (Figure 2), the interpreted spore colouration maturity profile shown in Figure is essentially continuous and with no breaks apparent. The spore colouration and the vitrinite reflectivity maturity profiles are not affected by the presence of the Upper Jurassic slide block within the Aptian of the Cromer Knoll Group. This is to be expected as maturation of the section occurred as result of deeper burial during the later Cretaceous and primarilly during the Tertiary. In the deepest part of the well section, over the middle to late mature interval 4000m to 4306mTD, spore colouration indices between and were recorded, which are slightly higher than would be expected from the spore colouration maturity profile. The spore colouration index maturity profile shows that at the transition from middle to late maturity for oil generation'at 4100m, spore colouration index of about would be expected. The slightly higher spore colour index values recorded may indicate minor additional heating effects due to fluid circulation within the predominantly arenaceous Fangst Group, although a corresponding increase in the vitrinite reflectivity gradient at this depth is not apparent. 3.2 Vitrinite Reflectivity The vitrinite reflectivity data obtained are of variable but generally fair quality. The samples analysed contain mainly humic kerogens and therefore sufficient particles were generally available for reflectivity determination, however, these are often higher reflecting inertinite macerals or reworked if Groupvitrinite. In the deeper part of the well section, populations of lower reflecting humic particles were noted which are probably caved from higher in the well section. Overall, the vitrinite reflectivity data are of good quality and enable consistent maturity profile to be constructed. Over the immature interval (1030m to 2200m) the interpreted vitrinite reflectivity maturity profile increases from about 0.29% to 0.43%. Over the early mature interval (2200m to 3600m), which corresponds to the spore colouration index range to about 6.0, the interpreted vitrinite reflectivity maturity profile increases from 0.43% to about 0.65%. The transition from middle to late maturity based largely on the airspace gaseous hydrocarbon analysis data, is placed at 4100m and is correlated with vitrinite reflectivity of about 0.80%. Over the late mature interval 4100m to 4306mTD the interpreted vitrinite reflectivity maturity profile increases only slightly from 0.80% to about 0.85%. The vitrinite 'reflectivity maturity profile is essentially continuous, with no maturity breaks being apparent. Extrapolation of the maturity profile to the normal surface intercept does not show any observable effects due to any uplift and erosion of section. 3.3 Airspace Gaseous Hydrocarbons The airspace gaseous hydrocarbon analysis data are given in Table 4(A-I). Total C1-C4 gas yields and the percentage of wet (C2-C4) gases are shown against depth in Figure 3. The iso-butane/normal butane ratios calculated in Table (A-I) are plotted against depth in Enclosure 1. Total airspace gas yields are variable throughout the well section. Total gas yields are moderately high in the upper part of the well section, reaching maximum of 31000 ppm at 1270m-1300m. The proportion of wet (C2-C4) gaseous hydrocarbons is generally low and increases steadily with depth to reach about 20% at approximately 2000m, thereafter remaining at about this level until approximately 3400m. Iso-butane/normal butane ratios are generally high in the upper part of the well section, reflecting the immature to early mature nature of the organic materials. At about 3000m the ratio begins to decrease more or less steadily f j_!)/ Robertson 11,-%%01 Group with depth, trend which is paralleled with general increase in the total gas yield and also in the percentage of wet airspace gaseous hydrocarbon components. The onset of middle maturity is placed at 3600m. Over the interval 3600m to 4100m the iso-butane/normal butane ratio remains relatively constant, between 0.2 and 0.5. Over the late mature interval 4100m to 4306mTD, the percentage of wet gaseoua components remains high, approximately 70% of total airspace gaseous hydrocarbons, although the total gas yield decreases relatively steadily with depth from about 30000-40000 ppm to values generally less than 10000 ppm. The slight increase in the iso-butane/normal butane ratio, which is apparent from Enclosure 1, is attributed to progressive increase in the importance of carbonium ion processes which tend to favour the more stable iso-butane at late mature levels (Alexander et al., 1983). 3.4 Gasoline Hydrocarbons The total yield of gasoline range (C4-C7) hydrocarbons, which is plotted against depth in Figure 4, increases markedly at about 3600m, which is consistent with the attainment of middle maturity for oil generation at about this depth. The gasoline hydrocarbon ratios, given in Table 6, do not appear to show any maturity dependant trend. Over the sample interval 3585m-3594m to 4287m-4296m heptane and isoheptane values vary relatively little, the 2-methylpentane/3-methylpentane ratio shows very little variation and the composition of C7 hydrocarbons, indicated by the proportion of normal, branched and cyclic components (Figure 6) also shows little variation. The data appear to be consistent with the suggestion made from the extraction, fractionation and alkane gas chromatography data (Section 4) that minor amounts of oil staining are present in the Viking Group and also in the lower part of the Cromer Knoll Group. 3.5 Rock-Eval Pyrolysis Tmax The Rock-Eval pyrolysis Tmax maturity data are shown against depth in Enclosure 1. The samples analysed show little sigiificant variation in kerogen type, being mainly of vitrinitic and inertinitic composition. The pyrolysis Tmax values therefore increase linearly with depth, and provide useful confirmation of the maturity levels as determined by microscopic techniques. The pyrolysis tcli Robertson 111.1 GroupTmax maturity profile increases from about 430*C-435C at 3090m-3100m to about 450C-455C at 4252m-4260m. These data are consistent with the spore colouration and vitrinite reflectivity results, taking into consideration the generally humic nature of the kerogens in the samples analysed. 3.6 Burial History Modelling The stratigraphic breakdown of the 6407/5-1 well and the formation temperature data available have been used to calculate theoretical maturity values using the method of Boyden et al. (1980) and the correlation of Goff (1983). The results have been compared with the spore colouration and vitrinite reflectivity results obtained. It should be stressed that the only source of formation temperature data has been the recorded maximum bottom hole temperatures on the wireline logs. Corrections for the cooling effect of drilling fluid circulation were applied using the empirical method of Carstens and Finstad (1981) whilst more reliable log temperature of 154.6C at 4306m, corrected using Horner-type plot, was provided by the client. The bottom hole temperature data available for the well are plotted against depth in Figure 8. The time-thickness curve is given in Figure 9, which also shows the increase in temperature with depth in the well. It is noted that the effect of the water depth and air gap on the temperature profile is taken into account by the temperature scale. Important assumptions in the model are that the present day geothermal gradient is linear, that the temperature gradient has remained invariant throughout geological time and that the water depth has remained similarly unchanged. Whilst these are clearly gross assumptions they are acceptable in order to simplify the modelling process. The temperature-time index calculations give P-value at 4306mTD of which, according to the correlation of Goff (1983) based on the Viking Graben, corresponds to vitrinite reflectivity of 0.71%. This is in approximate corrospondence with the observed values which are in the range 0.80-0.85%. IZIRobertson Group4 SOURCE ROCK EVALUATION The source rock characteristics of the 6407/5-1 well section have been evaluated by total organic carbon content determination, by Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and by solvent extraction, chromatographic fractionation of extracts and gas chromatography of alkane fractions. The chemical analysis data are summarised in Table 2(A-K) and the full Rock-Eval pyrolysis data are given in Table 3(A-G). The alkane gas chromatograms are presented in Figure 11(1-14) and the interpretative data are given in Table 7. The source rock evaluation data are summaried in Enclosure 2, the geochemical source summary log. 4.1 Cromer Knoll Group (3019m to 3873m; sample interval 3010m to 3873m) The Lange Formation of the Cromer Knoll Group (Cenomanian to Ryazanian age) was analysed in the sample interval 3010m to 3873m. The sample interval 3010m to 3585m comprises largely medium and medium-dark grey shales. Total organic carbon contents of composite lithologies are uniformly below average throughout this interval, varying between 0.72% and 0.99%. Picked shales at 3360m-3370m and 3477m-3486m have only slightly higher total organic carbon contents of 1.00% and 1.12% respectively. Pyrolysis potential yields of the samples analysed are very low. Hydrogen indices are similarly very low, ranging between 12 mg/gTOC and 46 mg/gTOC. These data are entirely consistent with the visual kerogen data which show humic, predominantly inertinitic kerogen types with no source potential. Total organic contents in the sample interval 3585m to about 3693m are higher than those observed in shallower and deeper sections of the Cromer Knoll Group. These samples are representative of the Upper Jurassic slide block. Pyrolysis hydrogen indices are similar to those obtained for the underlying Viking Group and indicate gas-prone kerogens of humic, vitrinitic and inertinitic composition with no significant source potential. Dark argillaceous lithologies in the sample interval 3693m to 3873m have generally average or slightly below average total Pyrolysis analyses at 3720m-3729m and at 3792m-3801m inertinitic kerogen types with no source potential. organic carbon contents. are indicative of largely The data for the sample jp,!-r-oi Robertson i Group3864m-3873m suggest that the sample is more representative of the underlying Viking Group, Spekk Formation. It is concluded that the Cromer Knoll Group analysed in the 6407/5-1 well has no hydrocarbon source potential. 4.2 Viking Group (3873m to 4205m; sample interval 3873m to 4206m) The source rock potential of the Spekk and Melke Formations of the Viking Group are considered separately. 4.2.1 Spekk Formation (3873m to 4105m; sample interval 3873m to 4107m) The Spekk Formation of the Viking Group (of Ryazanian to Oxfordian age) is relatively uniform in lithological andgeochemical characteristics throughout the sample interval 3873m to 4107m. The samples comprise mainly grey-black mudstones with generally subordinate amounts of other shale, mudstone and claystone lithologies and trace amounts of sandstone. Total organic carbon contents show moderate degree of variation but are generally above average. Values for composite samples vary between 1.79% and 7.05% and average 3.91% throughout the Spekk Formation. Despite the good total organic carbon contents, the pyrolysis and the visual kerogen data show that the organic matter is predominantly gas-prone and has no oil source potential. Pyrolysis potential yields are variable, from as low as 720 ppm at 3972m-3981m up to maximum of 8540 ppm for the picked, grey-black mudstone at 3891m-3900m, the higher pyrolysis potential yields being obtained for organically richer samples. Hydrocarbon indices are, however, uniformly law. These range between 36 mg/gTOC and 158 mg/gTOC and are indicative of humic, type III/type IV kerogen types of vitrinitic and inertinitic composition, with no significant oil source potential. This is confirmed by the visual kerogen data, which, for the drill cuttings samples and the core sample at 3972m analysed, show humic kerogens of predominantly inertinitic composition with subordinate vitrinite. riRobertsonIt is concluded that the Spekk Formation in the sample interval 3873m to 4107m will not have generated oil in attaining the present middle mature level. The Spekk Formation may have gas source potential which would be realised at higher levels of maturity. Solvent extraction yields of samples from the Spekk Formation are moderate, between 3075 ppm and 8540 ppm, whilst extract percentage of organic carbon values vary between 16.8% and 8.1%, the higher values being recorded for the organically richer samples in the upper part of the section. These data, in conjunction.with the extract fractionation and alkane gas chromatography data, may indicate the presence of minor migrant hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis analysis after solvent extraction of samples at 3873m-3882m, 3891m-3900m(P), 3909m-3918m, 3918m-3927m, 3973.0m and 4098m-4107m(P) shows that total organic carbon contents and Rock-Eval hydrogen indices are reduced after extraction. The data indicate that migrant hydrocarbons present in the section contribute to pyrolysis S2 yields. The extract fractionation data indicate the similarity in chemical composition of the extracts throughout the section. Hydrocarbons constitute between 78% and 89% of the total extracts whilst, with the exception of the sample 3878m-3882m, alkane hydrocarbons comprise between 58% and 73% of the total hydrocarbons. Figure 10, ternary plot showing the composition of solvent extraction yields in terms of alkane and aromatic hydrocarbon and polar fractions, illustrates the similarity in terms of solvent extract composition of samples for the Viking Group. Alkane gas chromatograms of samples from the Spekk Formation (Figure 11.4 to 11.13) are all similar. The predominance of shorter carbon chain length normal alkanes, together with the pristane/n-C17 and phytane/n-C 18 ratios and also the carbon preference indices, which are all around unity (Table 7), are consistent with generation of the hydrocarbons from source rocks of middle maturity. The predominance of shorter carbon chain length normal alkanes, indicated by the peaking of the normal alkane envelopes in the region n-C 12 to n-C17' combined with the relative proportion of the longer chain length, waxy - normal alkanes above about n-C24, is not strongly consistent with the humic, vitrinitic and inertinitic kerogen types observed, but is more indicative of minor amounts of oil stain derived from middle mature source rock containing marine-derived, sapropelic kerogen. The presence of higher molecular weight, f Robertson t% Groupwaxy normal alkanes in the range n-C 24 to n-C26 may indicate some contribution of terrestrially derived organic matter to the minor oil staining. If the hydrocarbons analysed by alkane gas chromatography do indeed represent minor migrant oil staining, then it is likely that the hydrocarbons are derived .from an oil-prone, sapropelic kerogen equivalent of the Viking Group. Further analysis of limited number of samples by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry is recommended in order to fully resolve the distribution of polycyclic molecular biomarker compounds. This would assist in clarifying whether the hydrocarbon extracts do indeed represent minor oil staining of the section and would determine the maturity and kerogen facies of the source of the hydrocarbons. 4.2.2 Melke Formation (4105m to 4205m; sample interval 4107m to 4206m) The samples analysed consist of dark grey and medium-dark grey shales and .mudstones with minor moderate brown mudstone and trace to minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone. Total organic carbon contents of the composite samples vary from below average to slightly above average, with values between and 2.26%. Total organic carbon contents of picked, individual lithologies are of similar range, with values between 0.82% and 2.72%. The pyrolysis data for the organically richest of the samples indicate that this middle mature interval has no remaining source potential. Pyrolysis potential yields are low, between 180 ppm and 1490 ppm, whilst hydrogen indices do not exceed 54 mg/gTOC. The visual kerogen data for the drill cuttings sample 4125m-4134m and 4188m-4197m and for the sidewall core sample 4181m show kerogens of humic, predominantly inertinitic composition with minor vitrinite. The extract fractionation data and the alkane gas chromatogram for the sample 4161m-4170m (Table 2.1; Figure 10; Figure 11.14) indicate the similarity in the chemical composition of the extract of this sample from the Melke Formation with those of the overlying Spekk Formation. The data show that the shales of the Melke Formation do not contain any oil-prone, sapropelic kerogen and will not have generated significant hydrocarbons in attaining the present level of maturity. The Melke Formation is not sufficiently rich to have any significant gas source potential. 15. .1 Robertson I Group4.3 Fangst Group (4205m to 4306mTD; sample interval 4206m to 4306mTD) The Garn Formation of the Fangst Group (Bathonian to Lower Bajocian age) was .penetrated in the interval 4205m (log depth) to 4306mTD. The samples submitted for geochemical analysis include drill cuttings samples from 4206m to 4306mTD and two core samples from 4207m and 4211m. Drill cuttings samples from the interval 4224m to 4306m comprise mainly yellow-grey sandstone with variable but generally subordinate amounts of shale and mudstone lithologies, which may, at least in part, be caved from the overlying Viking Group. Composite lithologies have low total organic carbon contents between 0.26% and 0.572. The drill cuttings samples 4206m-4215m and 4215m-4224m comprise predominantly dark grey shale with subordinate arenaceous material. The core samples 4207m and 4211m, however, consist of organically lean, light grey sandstones, with low total organic carbon contents of 0.33% and 0.47% respectively. I; is likely that the dark grey shale is caved from the overlying Viking Group. It is concluded that the Garn Formation of the Fangst Group consists largely of organically lean sandstones which will not have generated hydrocarbons in attaining the present middle to late level of maturity. 16 fr' /Robertson :qv5 CONCLUSIONS A petroleum geochemical evaluation has been carried out on drill cuttings, core and sidewall core samples from the interval 1030m to 4306mTD in the Mobil Exploration Norway Inc., 6407/5-1 well, drilled in the Haltenbanken area of the Norwegian Sea, and the following Conclusions have been reached: 1. The well section is immature from 1030m to approximately 2200m, early mature .fram 2200m to 3600m, middle mature for oil generation from 3600m to about 4100m and late mature for oil from 4100m to 4306mTD. The interval from seafloor to 1030m is interpreted to be immature. 2. The spore colour index and vitrinite reflectivity maturity gradients are continuous, with no maturity breaks apparent. . Extrapolation of the maturity gradients to the surface shows no observable effects due to any uplift and erosion of section. The Upper Jurassic slide block within the Aptian of the Cromer Knoll Group does not affect the maturity profiles, as maturation occurred during later Cretaceous and Tertiary burial. 3. Maturity modelling using the limited wireline log temperature data available for the well predicts maturity values which closely approximate the observed values indicating that present day burial depths are maximal. 4. The mainly medium and medium-dark grey shales of the Lange Formation of the Cromer Knoll Group analysed in the sample interval 3010m to 3873m (Cenomanian to Ryazanian) have generally below average total organic carbon contents and contain inertinitic and vitrinitic kerogens. This early to middle mature section has no significant hydrocarbon source potential. 5. The Spekk Formation of the Viking Group in the sample interval 3873m to 4107m (Ryazanian to Oxfordian age) consists, largely of dark, argillaceous lithologies, which have above average total organic carbon contents. The kerogens are of vitrinitic and inertinitic composition and are therefore gas-prone with no oil source potential. The interval may have minor gas generation potential, which would be realised at higher levels of maturity than observed in the well section. NI Robertson6. The mainly dark, argillaceous lithologies of the Melke Formation of the Viking Group in the sample interval 4107m to 4206m (Oxfordian to Lower Callovian age) have generally average amounts of organic carbon and contain mainly inertinitic kerogens with subordinate vitrinite. The interval has no source potential. 7. The airspace gas, gasoline, solvent extraction, fractionation and alkane gas chromatography analyses carried out largely on samples from the Viking Group indicate the presence of minor migrant oil staining derived from middle mature source, possibly an oil-prone, sapropelic kerogen equivalent of the Viking Group seen in the 6407/5-1 well. 8. The Garn Formation of the Fangst Group, of Bathonian to Lower Bajocian age, analysed in the sample interval 4206m to 4306mTD, comprises mainly organically lean sandstones with minor dark shales which may be largely caved from the overlying Viking Group. The interval has no source potential and has not generated hydrocarbons in attaining the present middle to late mature level.

Analytical pathways are shown on the flow chart (Appendix Figure 1) and details of laboratory procedures and techniques are given in the text. These may in certain circumstances be adapted to suit particular samples or conditions. Interpretation guidelines are also defined. 1. Sample ?reparation General Samples are received into the laboratories in the forms of well-site canned ditch cuttings, bagged ditch cuttings in various stages of preparation from wet, unwashed to dried, washed; sidewall cores, conventional cores, outcrop samples, crude oil samples and gas samples. Each sample is assigned number which is entered into computer system to monitor sample selection and progress. Preparation techniques are directed towards obtaining clean samples, free of drilling mud and mud additives, obvious caving contamination and indeterminate fine material. Washing with cold water is standard but further washing with solvent (dichloromethane. DCM) is carried out if oil-based mud is present, after which samples are dried, described and individual lithologies hand-picked where practicable. Samples are rough crushed to approximately pea-sized fragments for kerogen preparation or finely milled for chemical analysis. 1111Kerogen Preparation Kerogen concentrates for microscopic examination and elemental analysis are prepared using standard palynological procedures but omitting oxidation or acetolysis. Acid maceration involves the use of hot hydrochloric acid (HC1) to remove carbonates and hot 60% hydrofluoric acid (HF) to remove or break down silicates. Mineral residues are separated from the kerogen by combination of ultrasonic vibration and zinc bromide flotation. Kerogen samples for spore colour and kerogen typing are mounted on glass slides in glycerin jelly, those for vitrinite reflectivity are dried and mounted in epoxy resin. Kerogen residues are stored in methanol. 2. Maturity Evaluation The techniques employed for interpreting maturity and thermal history in these laboratories are based mainly on spore colouration and vitrinite reflectivity measurement, supplemented by data obtained from airspace gas and gasoline analysis, pyrolysis Tmax, and hydrocarbon analysis including gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Spore Colouration Sporomorph colour is assessed using >20u sieved kerogen fraction viewed in transmitted light on standard 11111 palynological microscope. Unusual hues are checked using incident blue/UV light fluorescence. Measurement is made by eye against reference sets of single grain spore mounts and trained operators achieve high degree of accuracy and reproducibility. The to 10 Spore Colour Index (SCI) scale was designed for linearity with increasing depth and temperature and correlates approximately with the following zones of oil generation: to 3.5, immature; to 5.0, early mature, generation of low gravity oils (28 to 35 'API); to 7.0, middle mature, generation of medium gravity oils (35 to 42API); to 8.5, late mature, generation of light oils (>42API) and condensates; to 10, post mature, generation of condensate, wet gas and, ultimately, dry gas. Linearity of scale is of great value in prediction, by extrapolation, of the depth to any part of the oil generation sequence. The value of SCI measurement lies in the objective selection of measured grains, so minimising problems of caving and reworking, and in its more direct correlation against oil generation than vitrinite reflectivity measurement. Limitations in its use concern the difficulty of correlation against other colour scales and the insensitivity of the scale in the late to post mature region. Anomalous colours may result from bleaching or staining during deposition and diagenesis. The correlation of SCI against Thermal Alteration Index (TAI) given on the SCI versus depth plot in the reports was made by direct comparison of Staplin's standard slides with SCI standard slides. Vicrinite Reflectivity The majority of preparations examined under reflected light in these laboratories are made using >20u sieved kerogen, mounted in resin blocks and polished with carborundum and alumina although total kerogen may be used when sample size is / 1Robertson klimited. Picked coals, organic-rich shales or limestones containing solid bitumen are mounted directly in resin blocks and polished in the usual way. Measurement is made on Leitz Orthoplan microscope fitted with an MPV Compact photometer which feeds values direct to desk top computer for data processing from each sample. The system is calibrated against glass standards and reflectance values are expressed as arithmetic means of measurements taken in oil immersion (Ro or Rm oil). Rmax and Rxi may be measured and quoted in certain circumstances but the difference is insignificant below about Ro LOX. Some operator selection of particles during measurement is essential and obvious contaminants or non-vitrinitic material are noted but not necessarily quoted. The value quoted on data tables is that which is interpreted as most appropriate, but other possibilities may also be given. Plotted figures assume logarithmic increase of reflectance with depth. Ro 0.5% is widely accepted threshold value for the onset of oil generation, although as the kinetics of oil generation may not be identical to those of vitrinite reflectivity development this must be seen only as general guide. The floor for oil generation is characterised by reflectance value of about 1.3%. Wet gas generation peaks at value of about 1: and ceases at the 2: level. Dry gas generation peaks at reflectance of about 1.5: and ceases at the 3% to 4% level. Correlation of reflectance values with other maturity parameters may not be universal because of time-temperature factors and is best made on local basis. Reflectivity measurement is widely used and versatile tool which may be readily calibrated against easily obtained 111, standards. It is applicable over wide range of maturity stages from immature to post mature (0.2: to 5% 110). High surface intercepts on plotted figures and discordances at faults and unconformities can give realistic estimates of the amount of section missing. It is of limited value in Early Palaeozoic sections where land plant material is absent, although general guide to maturity may be obtained from chitinous organic matter. Even skilled operator may have difficulty in distinguishing indigenous vitrinite from some forms of inertinite, anomalously reflecting pseudovitrinite, cavings and reworked fragments. Airspace Gas Analysis Wet cuttings are collected at the well site and sealed in partly full cans containing bactericide. In the laboratory, the airspace (headspace) gas is extracted using can piercer fitted with septum and analysed by gas chromatography. The proportions of methane, ethane, propane, iso- and n-butane are calculated from integrated peak areas by comparison with standard mixture of these gases. Methane is the dominant gas in immature and post mature sediments, comprising 90-100% of total gas, falling to 30-70% in mature sediments. The onset of maturity for oil generation (SCI 3.5) is characteristically marked by an increase in wet gas (C2-C4) to between 10 and 20% with further increases in maturity indicated by decrease in the ratio of iso- to n-butane. Ratios of >1.0 are typical for immature sediments and <0.5 are usual in mature sediments. Departures from composition versus depth trends may be usefut in indicating migrant gas at faults, unconformities or reservoir rocks but limit the method as reliable maturity indicator. Airspace gas analysis is an inexpensive and rapidly executed method of screening samples for further maturity and hydrocarbon content 111/1 determinations. Gasoline Analysis and Cuttings Gas Analysis Cuttings samples received wet, preferably in sealed containers, are suitable for gasoline and cuttings gas analysis. portion of the washed cuttings sample is retained wet, pulverised in sealed shaker and warmed to expel the CI to C7 hydrocarbon components into the shaker airspace. sample of this airspace gas is then removed and analysed by gas chromatography either for cuttings gas (C1 to C4) or gasoliaes (C4 to C7). Up to 28 hydrocarbon components are identified in the C4 to C7 range and their relative proportions calculated from integrated peak areas with reference to standard mixtures. Immature source rocks yield low total abundances and limited numbers of components whereas mature source rocks usually contain full complement of identified hydrocarbons with the onset of maturity indicated by rapid rise in total gasoline abundances with depth. Anomalous amounts of gasolines may mark the presence of oil stain. Gasolines may be used in oil to oil or oil to source rock correlations but the concentration of some of the measured components is not only function of source but also depends on maturity, migration and alteration in the reservoir. Using the most stable compounds, pairs with similar chemical structure and boiling points are reduced to pair ratios and compared with the same pair ratios in other oils or possible source rocks. Gasoline analysis is valuable tool in that it measures directly the hydrocarbons being generated from sediment but its sensitivity in detecting traces of oil places constraints on its use as maturity indicator. IN. 'RobertsonRock-Eval Pyrolysis, Gas Chromatograohy (GC) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Soectrometry (GC-MS) in Maturity Analysis 11111 These three analytical processes measure parameters which are functions of both maturity and kerogen type. Data from them may give general guide to maturity but if the kerogen types are known, more specific conclusions may be drawn. From Rock-Eval data, the temperature of maximum rate of pyrolysis, Tmax, is the most useful datum; gas chromatograms of alkanes, separated from source rock extracts or oils, yield carbon preference indices (CPI) and isoprenoid ratios; GC-MS quantitative-fragmentograms provide abundance ratios for specific compounds which are particularly useful in assessing the level of maturity at which source rock hydrocarbons or oils have been generated. All these supplementary data may be used to confirm results from visual analysis or supplant them if poor or unavailable. 3. Source Rock Evaluation Total Organic Carbon Content (TOC) Organic carbon values are obtained by treating 0.1g of crushed rock sample with hoc, concentrated HC1 to remove carbonates. The washed residue is filtered on to glass fibre pad and ignited in Leco carbon analyser. For screening purposes, samples are analysed singly but where further analyses, such as pyrolysis or solvent extraction are anticipated, duplicate sample is run. Blanks and standards are run as routine and where values from duplicated samples do not concur within strict accuracy limits, they are rerun. Where samples are heavily stained with oil, either from natural deposits or drilling mud, TOC is repeated on the dried, solvent extracted sample. 11111 TOC measurement is fundamental in assessing source rock quality since when combined with kerogen type and maturity, full description of the potential to generate oil may be given. It is found in practice that sediments containing less than 0.3% TOC are unlikely to have any source potential, those containing between 0.3% and 1% may be marginal sources but the better quality sources contain in excess of 1% TOC. Screening by TOC is therefore an inexpensive and rapid method of selection of samples for further analysis in source potential evaluation. Rock-Eval Pyrolysis Pyrolysis data are obtained using the IFP-Fina Rock-Eval apparatus. 100 mg of crushed, whole rock either from bulk sample or picked lithology is weighed accurately into crucible and introduced into furnace at 250C. Free hydrocarbons (roughly equivalent to solvent extractable hydrocarbons) are volatilised and quantified by flame ionisation detector (FID) to give Peak (SI, ppm). The furnace temperature is increased to 550C at 25C/minute and within this range, kerogens crack to give hydrocarbons, measured by FID to give Peak (S2, ppm) and carbon dioxide, measured by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to give Peak (S3, ppm). The temperature at the maximum rate of evolution of cracked volatiles (Tmax) is measured automatically but can also be monitored visually. The instrument is calibrated daily using standards both at the beginning of the work period and at regular intervals thereafter and crucible blanks are run as routine. The tabulated data in reports comprise the following parameters: Tmax C - temperature of maximum rate of Peak hydrocarbon evolution. IIIIHydrogen Index (HI) Oxygen Index (On S2/TOC (mg/g) or ratio of released hydrocarbon to organic carbon content. This is measure of the hydrocarbon generating potential remaining in the kerogen as opposed to that of the whole rock. - S3/TOC (mg/g) or ratio of released carbon dioxide to organic carbon content. Production Index (PI)- SI/Sii-S,, or ratio of the amount of hydrocarbons released in the first stage of heating to the total amount of hydrocarbons released and cracked during pyrolysis. Potential Yield (PT) - S2 (ppm) or total of hydrocarbons released during cracking of kerogen compared to original weight of rock. Tmax, hydrogen index and oxygen index are each functions of both maturity and kerogen type. Using published and empirical data, it has been possible to assemble model to show the relationships of these factors to maturity as measured by spore colouration and vitrinite reflectivity for selection of pure kerogen types. The kerogen types used are algal sapropel (type I), waxy sapropel (type II), vitrinite (type IIIA) and inertinite (type IIIB) and computer program has been devised by which the amounts of these components may be calculated from the HI, OI, Tmax and maturity 'Robertson I____Groupdata for any sample. These are the values expressed in the kerogen composition by calculation columns tabulated in the reports. The hydrogen index is measure of the hydrocarbon generating potential of the kerogen and is analogous to the atomic H/C ratio. Immature, organically rich source rocks and oil shales give values above 500, mature oil source rocks give values between 200 and 550. For given kerogen type, these values progressively diminish with increasing maturity. The temperature of maximum rate of pyrolysis depends partly on the kerogen type but the transition from iamature to mature organic matter is marked by temperatures between 415 and 435C. The maturity transition from oil and wet gas generation to dry gas generation is marked by temperatures between 455 and 460C. In practice, greater variation than these ideal temperature ranges may be seen, but they are nevertheless useful as general guides to the level of maturity attained by the sediment. The production index increases with maturity from values near zero for immature organic matter to maximum values of during the late stages of oil generation. Anomalously high values indicate the presence of oil or contaminants. The potential yield is an indication of the predicted yield of hydrocarbons from the source rock at optimum maturity and is 111/1 measure of the quality of the source rock. For immature sediments, values of to 2000 ppm of hydrocarbon characterise poor source rock, 2000 to 6000 ppm fair, 6000 to 20 000 ppm good and above 20 000 ppm very good. Pyrolysis techniques have in recent years provided major advance in the assessment of source rock quality and generating potential. Hydrocarbon yields from immature source beds examined on-structure may be translated into actual oil productivity from the same beds in mature basinal, off-structure situations. Models relating maturity and kerogen type may be used to define original source rock quality grades which are of great value in mapping organic facies. Amorphous kerogen types, indistinguishable in microscopic preparations over wide range of chemical properties, may be readily differentiated by pyrolysis. The problem of analysing bulk samples containing mixed kerogens has been largely overcome by the kerogen type/maturity model and anomalous results arising from the presence of caving contamination and drilling mud additives can usually be explained by inspection. High oxygen indices sometimes occur as result of the presence of metastable carbonates and in such cases the sample is acid decarbonated and re-run. Visual Examination of Kerogen Concentrates All palynological preparations on which SCI determinations are made are also examined for kerogen type. Visual estimations of the relative abundance of the broad groups vitrinite, inertinite and sapropel are made on the total kerogen slide mount but reference is also made to the >200 sieved fraction to assist in identification. The scheme of identification is shown in Appendix Table 1. Full use is made of incident blue or UV light in distinguishing immature III/1 or early mature oil-prone kerogen from gas-prone kerogen. Extract Analysis The soluble organic materials present in rocks can be extracted with organic solvents, fractionated and analysed. The type and amount of material extracted depends largely upon the nature of the contained kerogen and its maturity, although the presence of migrant oil or drilling contamination may be the determining factors. A maximum of 40g of crushed sample is extracted for minimum of 12 hours in Soxhlet apparatus using laboratory redistilled DC!. The solvent and the more volatile components (approximately up to n-C15) are lost by evaporation in an air flow and the resulting total extract is weighed, dissolved in hexane and separated into alkane (saturate) hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, resene and asphaltene (polar) fractions by silica adsorption chromatography in the Iatroscan process. Larger fractions, suitable for further analysis, are obtained by column chromatography. The extract is run through short glass column packed with silica and alumina and eluted with hexane (to give the saturate fraction), (3:1 hexane: toluene mixture (to give the aromatic fraction) and methanol (to give the polar, or resene and asphaltene, fraction). small proportion of non-eluted polar compounds usually remains on the column. 11,1RobertsonThe data tabulated in reports comprise the following parameters: .Total extract Hydrocarbons Extract of organic carbon (EPOC) Hydrocarbons mg/g of organic carbon Hydrocarbons % extract - total hydrocarbons as proportion of total extract. - soluble organic matter, heavier than about a-C15+, expressed as ppm of weight of rock. - sum of alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons, expressed as ppm of weight of rock. - total extract ppm; the extractability. TOC 100 - total hydrocarbons normalised to 1g of organic carbon. Alkanes hydrocarbons - the proportion of alkanes (saturates) in the total hydrocarbons. The proportion of aromatics is (100 minus this value) expressed as percentage. The extractability of oil-prone sapropelic organic matter increases rapidly in the oil generation zone and diminishes to very low values in post mature sediments. Overall the extractability of sapropelic organic matter is greater than that of gas-prone humic organic matter for similar levels of maturity. Samples with extractabilities of greater than 20% generally contain migrant oil or are contaminated with mud additives. As maturation proceeds in the oil generation zone the proportion of hydrocarbons in the total extract increases from less than 20Z to maximum in the most productive horizons of around 60%. This trend is reversed as the oil-condensate zone is entered. The relative proportions of alkanes to aromatics can be used as check for low levels of contamination. Fractions of the extract, separated by column chromatography are retained for further analysis by gas chromatography or for stable carbon isotope determination. Capillary Gas Chromatography of C154 Alkanes A portion of the Soxhlet extract is eluted with hexane through short silica column to yield the saturate hydrocarbon fraction. This fraction is evaporated in stream of dry nitrogen at room temperature. small portion of the fraction is then taken up in hexane and introduced into 25 metre, wall-coated, open tubular glass capillary column coated with OV-1, or equivalent, mounted in Carlo Erba gas chromatograph which is temperature programmed from 70C to 270C at 3C/minute. 111/1 C154. chromatograms are inspected for the distributions of n-alkanes, and the presence and abundance of isoprenoids _ (particularly pristane and phytane), steranes and triterpanes and unresolved envelopes of naphthenic compounds. The ratios pristane:phytane and pristane:n-C17 are calculated. Carbon Preference Index (CPI) values quoted are those as defined by Philippi as the ratio 2C29 to (C28+C30) unless otherwise stated. Chromatography may reveal information about the kerogen type of the source rock, its maturity and condition of deposition and, if migrant oil is present, whether this has been water-flushed or biodegraded. Contaminant drilling mud additives may be identified. Capillary Gas Chromatography of Aromatic and Branched/Cyclic Alkanes The aromatic portion of the Soxhlet extract is eluted from short silica/alumina column by hexane/toluene mixture. The dried fraction is taken up in DCM and introduced into 25 metre, wall-coated, open tubular glass capillary column coated with OV-1, or equivalent, mounted in Carlo Erba gas chromatograph which is temperature programmed from 70C to 270C at 3C/ minute. Branched chain alkanes are separated from normal alkanes by urea adduction and treated as for total alkanes.  /1 /Robertson Group111/1 Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry is technique in which molecules are bombarded with high energy electrons causing ionisation and fragmentation of the molecules into ions of varying mass(m) and charge(z). The way in which molecule fragments into ions of various m/z value is known as its fragmentation pattern, or mass spectrum and is unique. When linked to gas chromatograph the mass spectrometer can be used in two different modes:  1. Full Scan Mode: mass spectrum is obtained of each peak eluting from the gas chromatograph and structural identification of the compound producing that peak can be made. 2. Multiple or Single Ion Monitoring Mode: The mass spectrometer is tuned to certain m/z values to detect whether compound, eluting from the gas chromatograph, fragments to give an ion at that value. Certain fragmentations are indicative of specific compound types and the most commonly monitored fragment ions used in petroleum geochemistry are those with mix values of 191, 217 and 259 which are the principal fragment ions obtained from groups of alkanes known as triterpanes, regular steranes and rearranged sceranes respectively. These are compounds containing 27 to 35 carbon atoms arranged in polycyclic, normally or ring, structure, occurring in the ti-C26 to n-C35 region of gas chromatogram. The basic molecular skeletons of these compounds are very similar to those of the original organic matter deposited in the sediment and so these 191, 217 and 259 distribution plots, known as mass fragmentograms or mass chromatograms, form pattern characteristic of the source material. This technique of fingerprinting is also one of the more exact methods of correlating an oil to its source, or to another oil. Carbon Isotope (13C/12C) Ratio Analysis Carbon has two stable isotopes, the more abundant I2C isotope and the heavier I3C isotope, which in nature forms about 1% of carbon. Deviations from the 13C/12C ratio are extremely small and carbon isotope ratios, as measured by mass spectrometry, are expressed as deviations from standard, the Pee Dee Belemnite carbonate (PDB standard) in parts per thousand (parts per mil; 0/00. Positive deviations indicate I3C enrichment and conversely, negative deviations Indicate I3C impoverishment. While the carbon isotope ratios of oils and rock extracts can range from -20 to -32 0/00 depending on the source organic matter type, the difference between specific oil and its source is small. Measurements are usually made on the C15+ alkane and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions separately and there should be no more than 0/00 difference between the oil and its source for either fraction. If there is any doubt that the source rock extracts are not indigenous to the source rock kerogen, the carbon isotope ratio of the extracted source rock kerogen can be measured. Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography The hydrocarbon pyrolysate derived from thermal, anhydrous cracking of kerogen is analysed by capillary gas chromatography. few mg of rock, kerogen or asphaltene is heated to 600C for 20 seconds in the injector of gas chromatograph. The chromatograph oven is kept at -30C during pyrolysis and then raised to 300C at programmed rate of 7.5%/minute. Chromatograms produced this way are often very different from those of source rock extracts or oils in that branched and cyclic isomers are generated freely giving numerous, closely spaced peaks, along with unsaturated, alkene (olefin) hydrocarbons. The doublet peaks often observed in these chromatograms comprise alkene-alkane pairs, the first eluting, and usually smaller peak, being the alkene. The chromatograms range from CI to C30 or above and although variable, are broadly characteristic of source rock type. Gas-prone kerogen cracks to give more limited molecular weight range of products, concentrated towards the light ends, whereas oil-prone kerogen gives more prominent alkene-alkane doublets in the Cl2 to C30 region. The largest peak from both types is usually methane. Elemental Analysis Total (unsieved) kerogen is prepared as described in Section 1. The dried material is combusted in oxygen in an elemental analyser and the oxides of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur are measured. The unburnt residue is the ash content. Oxygen is usually calculated by difference but can be determined separately if required. Results are quoted as percentage weights of C, H, 0, N, and Ash with the atomic ratio H/C and 0/C calculated and plotted on the standard van Rrevelen diagram. The relative amounts of C, and present in organic matter are dependent on both source and maturity. At known maturity levels, some measure of source quality may be determined. Limitations of the method in source rock assessment involve the difficulty of obtaining pure kerogen (in particular, free from pyrite) and the lack of simple, direct determination of oxygen content. h'Robertson k4. Oil Analysis RRI laboratories offer wide range of oil analyses both for geochemical purposes and industrial use. Physical property determinations are based mainly on IP methods and are available for lubricating oils, fuels and greases as well as crudes. Frequently measured properties of crude oils presented in geochemistry reports include: API gravity, pour point, viscosity and contents of water, sulphur, wax, asphaltene, nickel, vanadium and other metals. Chemical analysis of oils involves the following: Whole oil gas chromatography - using split syringe injection and temperature programme from -20C or -30C up to 270C at 4C/minute. Associated gas - if oil has high gas/oil ratio. Gasoline analysis - as for gasolines in rock samples but weighed quantity of oil is used. Topping of the oil - this is equivalent to the removal of the fraction boiling below about 210C and gives more standardised product for comparison of gas chromatograms of the C15+ fraction. Column chromatography and - as for solvent extracts. Analysis is carried out on topped oil. 11111gas chromatography 5. Gas Analysis The hydrocarbon gases, CI to C4, may be collected from the airspace of sealed canned samples or may be received from well-site tests in special sealed gas cylinder (gas mouse). Chromatographic separation of the C, to C4 gases is effected as described under airspace gas analysis. In addition, the separated gas components may be analysed for stable carbon and hydrogen isotope composition which may provide valuable clues to the origin of the gas. 6. Solid Bitumen Analysis In some oil fields, problems are encountered where bitumen developments form continuous or patchy layers within reservoirs, dividing the pay zones and acting as barriers to natural fluid movement or inhibiting enhanced oil recovery techniques. Integrated geothemical and sedimentological studies aim to produce geological models capable of predicting the occurrence of bitumen layers and their likely thickness and ability to act as permeability barriers. Of further concern are the past or present relationships between the bitumen and reservoired oil, their source rocks and the timing 111/1 of bitumen formation. Analysis schemes involve screening of samples by assessing the amount of bitumen in polished core pieces using reflected light microscopy, followed by solvent extraction of control samples to estimate the proportion of solvent soluble bitumen. Different phases of bitumen formation are differentiated by reflectance measurement as described for vitrinite reflectance measurement. Soluble extracts are fractionated to give alkane, aromatics, asphaltene and resene components. Separated bitumens may be subjected to elemental analysis. hiRobertson RFLOW CHART FOR GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS Canned cuttings Cl - C4 SIMKO gases Wet bagged Orr bagged Soaked if hard Washed individually by Ihand in cold water Cl - CA outings gas C4 - C7 gasolines. 28 components Sidewad Corti Scraped clean of mudcake Cut surfaces removed Outcrop Nee thered surfaces Scrubbed :.ran wilt water Washed in OCM solvent if oil-stained or con aminated by oil-based drilkeg mud.
