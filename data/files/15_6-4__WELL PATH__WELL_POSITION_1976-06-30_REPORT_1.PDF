The rig arrived on location on 27 June 1976 and fix was obtained by 0500 on 29 June 1976. However, because of drilling difficulties, the rig was moved and  second fix obtained by 1000 on.30 June 1976. This report contains details olboth ' fixes. .  The final position of the centre of the derrick, obtained from the , last 3D pass on 30 June 1976 and adjusted to International Spheroid European Datum 1950 was:- Latitude: 58 37' North Longitude: 01 48' East This position is metres on bearing of 349.2 True from the intended location. The initial position of the centre;of the derrick on 29 June 1976, adjusted to International Spheroid European Datum 1950 was:-  Latitude:  58 37' North-2- REQUIREMENTS The requirements were to confirm the final position of 'Norjar!' by Sat Nay system aboard the rig as detailed in telex reference N. SM274 dated 18 June from Esso Exploration and Production Norway to Decca Survey Norway and Decca Survey Great Yarmouth . Quoting order number 6/0250.  . The revised intended location was given as:- Latitude: 58 37 North' Instruction for mobilisation was received by telex reference S-689. Reference should be made to Decca report 15/6-4/2094 for the site survey and rig move.-3- 2. MET HOD OF FIX AND RESULTS A) The mien ite antenna was positioned above the pilot house located at the bow of the rig. The antenna position was metres bearing 322 True from the centre of the derrick, with rig heading of 312o True. This position was determined relative to the centre of the derrick by referring to a scale plan of the rig and orientation of the rig obtained from the rigs gyro compass. Rig Heading .Traverse Corrections:- Latitude: Longitude: +1.267 -0.864 By referring to scale plan of the rig it was established that the antenna height above sea level was 24 metres when the rig was at its working draught of 21 metres.. This gave an antenna height above the spheroid of 70 metres. b) Initial Positioning For the initial rig location twenty-seven 3D passes were obtained on 28 June and 29 June 1976 (see enclosures).Me last 3D pass number twenty-seven gave the antenna position as:- Latitude: 58 37' North  This position was computed using computer programme based on the NWL 8D Spheroid. To correct this position to. International Spheroid EUropean Datum 1950, two metre; shift South was applied, and the position computed using the following shifts. + 84 metres +103 metres + 127 metres This procedure is as recommended by..S Brown Limited, the Magnavox agents in the United Kingdom, to compensate for the change in the :atellite reference spheroidto.WGS 72. This gave the following corrections to be applied at the location:- Latitude: +2.301 Longitude: + Therefore the corrected antenna position was:- Latitude:. 58 37' North . . Applying traverse corrections for rig heading of 312 True, the position of the centre of the derrick was:- Latitude: 58o 37' North Longitude: 010 48' East-5- Bearing and distance from the intended location :- 108 metres -004 The spread of the satellite fixes about the final set fix, from 3D pass number eighteen to 3D pass number twenty-seven was:- Longitude: The standard deviation was:- +0 metres + metres to metres Latitude: +0 metres Longitude: +0.75 metres - t) Final Positioning As it proved impossible to set the 30 inch casing in position, the rig was movecl to start new hole, and second fix was requested. For the second, and final location ninteeen 3D passes were obtained on 29 June- ' and 30 June 1976 (see enclosures) The last 3D pass, number ninteen, gave the. antenna position as:-  Applying the spheroid corrections as detailed above, the corrected antenna position was: 58 37 NorthApplying traverse correCtions for -rig heading of 312o Tru 2, the final, position of the centrd of the derrick was:- . Longitude: 01 4W East The spread of the satellite fixes about the final fix, from 3D pass number ten to 3D pass number ninteen was:- +0 metres to - metres Latitude: + metres Longitude: + metres' _ . . Lists cf 3D passes obtained and convergence graphs are included in the enclosures. Note:  Due to faults with satellite number 30180, fixes obtained from this satellite were edited out to avoid erroneous position shifts.-7- 3.

CHIEF SURVEYOR Euroshelf Operations Division EM DSBOV 20 July 19763.1) PROGRAM OPERATION Two types of printouts are provided, one 2D pass, the other is the primary 3D pass. The 2D program calculates latitude and longitude from the combined doppler data but uses in each case the original antenna height entered at initialization. The 3D position is only computed if the following criteria are met:- 1) Either an automatic 2D update has occured or the word UPDT has been typed(if the operator knows the reference position more accurately than the typical 213 position fix then he can force the 3D reference position to be the initialized position by typing UPDT). Otherwise, the program will automatically update and use as the reference position the first 2D position which is between 100 and 70o and meets all other fix criteria. Until this reference position is egablished no 3D position will be computed. 2) The pass elevation is equal to or greater than 15. 3) At least doppler counts prior to CA were obtained. 4) The residual RMS is less than 20 metres. Even after the 3D pass is computed it will automatically be deleted if the RMS residuals of the last pass exceed 20 metres. . Following are descriptions of pass parameters:- DAY Julian day of satellite pass occurrence TIME If four minutes after receiver lock LAT Computed latitude at time of pass ION Computed longitude at time of pass ANT Antenna height entered at initialization or in 3D printout the computed value ITER Number of linear iterations required for position convergence ELEV Elevation angle of satellite pass with respect to horizon GEOM Direction of travel of satellite and on which side of observer SAT Satellite number S-LA Estimates of latitude error based on RMS residuals. Estimate is in metres S-LO Estimate of longitude error based on RMS residuqls. Estimate S-AN Estimate of antenna height error based on RMS residuals.
