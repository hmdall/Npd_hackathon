One core was cut with 99.41% recovery, the core was processed into 1m sections on surface and shipped back to Stavanger for processing. We hope that BG is satisfied with the results and the quality of the coring services and the core material from this job, in particular we hope that the decisions taken after the Jordbr Central well have resulted in avoiding the problems seen on that well. We look forward to continuing our co-operation with BG in Norway. If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me.

The corebarrel was dressed with fluted aluminium inner barrels, the Telescopic Internal Lip Shoe (TILS) and heavy duty core catcher. The corehead used was new FC3743, seven-bladed corehead set with PDC cutters. The barrel was spaced out as per the procedure. The BHA was washed down from the last two stands towards bottom with 1,500LPM. The coring ball was dropped and pumped down and seated with 1,000LPM and then SCRs recorded and the other off-bottom parameters required. core was cut from 4,053m to 4,080m with moderate weight and steady parameters and good ROP. 4ton overpull was observed picking off bottom and no problems seen coming out of the hole. At surface the core was laid down and processed into one metre sections and shipped to town. 26.84m were recovered (99.41%) and the corehead was graded as 1-1-NO-A-X-I-RR-TD. 2 Overall performance Overall performance Metres cut 27 Metres recovered Coring hours Total barrel length (m) Average run length (m) Unfortunately there was only one core taken on this well however Halliburton DBS feel that this was still very successful coring operation. After the issue on the original Jordbr well where undergauge core was recovered on the Bredford Dolphin rig we feel that the measures taken to prevent this happening again have worked with the core quality being good. It may be beneficial for HDBS & BG Norge to meet and review the measures in detail. The standard key performance indicators of recovery percentage, penetration rate and corebarrel efficiency are all excellent and we hope to continue the teamwork that resulted in this successful operation.3 Jordbr Central Vs. Jordbr East The summary of recommendations from HDBS for the Jordbr East well was that the following key items should be adopted:  At least one roller reamer is run in the BHA  Utilise more aggressive PDC corehead  Adopt and implement specific procedure for this area (pre-coring torque evaluation)  Assess changing corehead out from one run to another if high torque is seen. The fourth one was not relevant as there was only one run but the other three recommendations were accepted by BG Norge and the optimal BHA for coring was supported and utilised. Of course the litmus test of success for this particular job is to compare the core from the original central well where the problem of under-gauge core was encountered with the core obtained on this well. 3.1 Representative photograph of core from 34/3-1S3.2 Representative photograph of core from 34/3-2 Halliburton DBS were pleased to view this core and hope that BG Norge are satisfied with the improvement in core quality; this is the normal standard of in-gauge core that we are accustomed to providing and we hope that the team effort to address the problems that occurred on one well can be successfully deployed in future in other coring operations.4 Offshore paperwork 4.1 Core4.2 Coring summaryItylernail Tervefature CC) +5.9 Report of file BG_Jordbaer East 18 Events f5VitsrningA 13 arms) Ma( +222 Tire 5ratil .34 golchartShock gocinrpeotrrJordbr,astE,GNB34/3-2S
