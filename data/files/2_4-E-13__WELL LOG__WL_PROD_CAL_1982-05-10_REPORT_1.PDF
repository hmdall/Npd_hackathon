Box 220 N-4056 Tananger Norway April 12, 19 - Amoco Norway Oil Co. - Texas Eastern Norwegian Inc - Amerada Petr. Corp.of Norwa - NOCO RE: CALIPER SURVEYS FROM TOR WELLS (REF. AMERADA ON MARCH 15) These caliper surveys of wells 2/4 E-1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 130and 16 indicate the condition of the internal surface of each well's tubing. The depth of the deepest penetration, and the number of joints within different ranges of penetra- tion are also reported. The caliper survey also comments on each joint of tubing for which corrosion is indicated. There are no caliper surveys for wells 2/4 E-7 and 14 because they have plastic-coated tubing. After well E-5 was calipered, it was recompleted with plastic-coated tubing in February 1982. Running caliper surveys in these wells would scratch and damage the plastic coating. All Tor wells are being monitored for corrosion with coupons and electrical resistance probes. CIV's are installed and squeeze treatments are run when the coupons and probes indi- cate corrosion. Presently CIV's are installed in wells 2/4 E-2, and 7. CIV's are scheduled to be installed later this year in well 2/4 E-14 and in wells 2/4 E-12 and after their workovers. During 1982, wells 2/4 E-1, 9, 10, 13, 14 and 16 were squeezed. Wells 2/4 E-1 and are scheduled to be squeezed later this year. Sincerely, oss, Chairman Tr nit Technical Committee Attachment cc: L.L.

Ekofisk, Norway TOR 2/4 #13 May 10, 1982 Survey No. 11766 Chart No. 17394 This is the first survey of this well to be made with the Kinley Microscopic Caliper. The condition of the internal surface of the 41/2 12.6# VAN tubing in the well, from to 11,910', is covered by this report. The deepest penetrations recorded in the survey measure or 22% of the tubing wall thickness. cross sectional drawing of Joint #255, at the level of penetration, is included. The condition of the tubing surveyed and analyzed appears good with respect to corrosion. Indications of damage, however, are recorded in a number of Joints. The damage is in the form of shallow pits, rings at the Makeups, and roughness of the tubing I.D. Slippage occurred during the survey, resulting in shorter than normal recordings for some Joints. Due to the slippage, the numbering of the Joints is speculative. CALIPER TECHNICIAN CALIPER REPORTER R. Jones Jerry Cruickshank sbb Distribution: PHILLIPS PETROLEUM COMPANY, AiihNTION: Mr. R. V.
