The gypsum injection ensure that core integrity is maintained during transport and handling of core without chilling or freezing. The gypsum injection method involves no use of hazardous chemicals. The core inner barrel is cut in meter sections by the coring company. The core sections are placed on custom made stands for drainage. At this stage the core is inspected for integrity, lithology and annular space and decision is reached in cooperation with the company well site geologist if the gypsum injection method is to be carried out. The gypsum will be injected into the core sections filling the core/ liner annular encapsulating the core. The Gypsum in filled core sections are given time to set before sections are moved/handled. The stabilised core sections are packed in Weatherford special made core containers before transportation to laboratory. The cored intervals were cut by I.D. core bit and retrieved in Aluminium inner core barrels. The cores were cut in sections of one metre length.2.2 Offshore Sampling Offshore plug drilling The well site plug sampling programme consisted of the following: Drill inch horizontal priority plugs (hot shot) for permeability and porosity measurements. Drill inch vertical centered plugs for Water saturation/invasion determination and additional analysis. The plugs were cut using an air driven plug drill and refined oil (Clarisol) as drillbit lubricant. To prevent any drying of the plug samples the plugs were wrapped in cling film, Aluminium-foil and sealed using ProtecCore laminate immediately after drilling. Number of plugs and sample depths are listed in Analysis Results, Appendix D. 3 SPECTRAL CORE GAMMA LOG A spectral core gamma log of the cores was performed by recording the natural gamma radiation from the cores using NaI crystal scintillator. The signals were detected and amplified through photo multiplicator tube, and recorded by computer connected multi channel analyser. The different radioactive minerals emit gamma rays of characteristic energy levels, and based on these levels the contributions from the minerals, potassium, uranium and thorium are specified. The quantitative description of the mineral content is based on calibration with standard calibration cores supplied by IFE, Institutt for Energiteknikk, Kjeller (Norway). The total and spectral core gamma log are reported in 1:200 scale, the total gamma is plotted in counts/minute (c/min), the concentration of potassium is plotted in %, and the concentrations of thorium and uranium in ppm. Spectral core gamma log plots are included in Appendix of this report. Restricted 104 CORE HANDLING AND SAMPLING Following above described studies the core was removed from the core inner barrel and wiped clean using dry rags before being measured and marked with way up lines and depth markings. Plug samples for routine analyses were drilled from all cores. These plugs were collected by drilling with one inch bore, using simulated formation brine (constructed to standard concentration of 50 000 ppm NaCl) as cooling agent. In order to characterise the petrophysical properties parallel to bedding, horizontal plugs taken every 25 cm. To represent vertical data, plug samples were drilled approximately every 50 cm, perpendicular to apparent bedding. The samples were cut to one inch lengths and the end faces were lightly brushed using the same fluid, to remove any fines induced by trimming. Plug off cuts were labelled and retained for possible further use. Prior to measurements the plug samples were cleaned in hot soxhlet extractor using alternating sequences of methanol and toluene. Toluene was used to remove any residual hydrocarbons and methanol to remove water and salt. The plug samples were dried in hot oven at 60 C between the toluene and methanol extraction to avoid mixing of the solvents. In order to ensure the complete removal of all pore contaminations the salt content in methanol was checked using silver nitrate (forms silver chloride in presence of chloride ions) The presence of hydrocarbons was gauged from visual inspection of the solvent used and UV fluorescence. Finally the samples were dried in hot oven at 60 C in 48 hours prior to the measurements. Restricted 11Core analysis well 16/2-14 T2 4.1 Unconsolidated plugs. Some core intervals were unconsolidated. These plugs were collected by drilling with one and half inch bore, using liquid nitrogen as cooling agent. The plugs were mounted in Hassler holders and exposed to confining pressure slowly increased to 20 bar. The samples were cleaned with cold solvents, alternating sequences of methanol and toluene, gently flushing through the samples at controlled flow rates. Prior to the analyses the samples were dried with lenient air flow. In order to avoid grain reorientation, the core plugs were kept in the Hassler holders, under constant confining pressure, until measurements of permeability and pore volume were completed. The plug number marked with   in Appendix are treated as unconsolidated plugs. Restricted 125 CT SCANNING CT-scanning The analytical programme required CT (Computer Tomography) of core material from this well. The resolution for the CT-Scan,s are 512 512 pixels. 5.1 CT Scanning Whole Core CT scanning visualises representative homogeneous sections for possible further studies. The CT scan also helps locating any fractured areas of the core, identify density variations and can be used as tool for orientation of the core prior to slabbing or subsequent plug sampling. The core still in unopened core inner barrels was CT-scanned to evaluate core quality. One overview picture (topogram) and four slice pictures were produced every 100-cm of core. The topogram is standard X-ray photo taken from above, covering 100 cm of core. It shows larger structures and fractures in the core, and is used for selection of detailed slice pictures. CT scans are presented as separate report. 5.2 CT Scanning Seal Peels All Seal Peels (preserved whole core) from this well were CT-scanned to evaluate core quality. One (topogram) overview picture, two radial and two axial slice pictures were produced for each seal peel. The topogram is standard X-ray Scan taken from above, covering the length of the preserved core sample. It shows larger structures and fractures in the core, and is used for selection of detailed slice pictures. The slice pictures are reading of radiation passing through the core. An X-ray source is sending pulses of energy through the core and set of detectors rotating around the core detects the passing signals. The readings are used for making computer produced slice picture of the core. When seal peels are CT scanned, print of the CT scan is mounted along with the core B-cut representing the removed whole core. The CT scans are presented as separate report. Restricted 136 PRESERVATION AND CORE PHOTOS 6.1 Preserved Whole Core samples Whole core samples (Seal Peels) for preservation were cut from the cores wrapped in cling film, aluminium foil and preserved in Ergoseal plastic impermeable coating. A list over preserved whole core samples is included in Appendix of this report. 6.2 Core photos For this study the following core photo services was performed. Standard digital core photos scale 1:4 of the A-cut, photographed in both white and UV- light. Standard digital core photos scale 1:4 of the B-cut, photographed in both white and UV- Digital core photos of the A-cut in white and UV-light were produced using the Weatherford developed photography system CORIMAG. The system generates high quality digital images of core material. Both U.V. and white light imaging in several resolutions and stored as TIFF files. The core photo are presented as separate report. Restricted 147 TRIAXIAL STRENGTH (STT) Simplified triaxial compressive strength tests were performed on 1x2 inch vertical samples. The tests were performed on natural moisture samples. The core plug compressive strength was determined by loading axial pressure to the sample in compression bi-axial core holder to sample failure (collapse). The triaxial compressive strength of the sample is defined as the highest pressure reading value before failure. A constant axial hydraulic (hand pump) pressure was applied, at constant radial (2 MPa) confining pressure. The time for hydrostatic loading up to MPa and time for consolidation was minimum minute. The confining pressure was kept constant at MPa and the axial pressure was increased until plug collapse. The time for loading in the shear phase upon rock failure is minimum minutes. The manometer (max. peak memory) read the failure pressure directly in MPa, the only adjustment required was small correction factor for the difference in piston and sample areas. A calculated correction factor of was required in this experiment to correct the compressive strength gauge reading. Ccorr = meas. * Results from the triaxial compressive strength tests are presented in Appendix of this report. Restricted 15Figure SST Equipment Setup Restricted 168 GRAIN SIZE Sieve analysis (grain size and distribution) are performed using core chips of approximately 50g sampled from fresh core. The samples are cleaned in soxhlet extractor using alternating sequences of methanol and toluene. Cleaned sample are dried at 60 0C for at least 48 hours prior to further preparing. The samples are disaggregated sufficient to reduce the sample to individual grains, without crushing grains or otherwise artificially create fines. The aim of this analysis is to determine grain sizes and distribution of the grain sizes in unconsolidated/loose sand. Grain size distribution analysis was performed on cleaned, dry and disaggregated samples using sonic sifter sieve apparatus. Mesh sizes used are as follows: 4000  2800  2000  1700  1400  1000  500  250  125  63  38  15  Number of samples and results from the sieve analysis are presented both tabular and graphic in Appendix of this report. Restricted 179 SATURATION 9.1 Dean & Stark Fluid saturation analyses were performed by Dean-Stark method on inch plugs drilled offhore: Plugs for Sw were drilled with Clarisol oil as cooling agent. Water was extracted from the plugs using toluene, giving direct water volume readings. The amount of water extracted from each sample was recorded. Method: Toluene has boiling point of approx. 110C. When the toluene reaches the boiling point, heat from the toluene vapor causes the water in the sample to evaporate. The toluene- and water vapor both condense in water cooler. The water is collected in water-trap. The toluene in its liquid state flows back and soaks the sample, extracting the oil in the sample. See Figure 9.1, standard D&S equipment setup. The water in the water collector is distilled. Dissolved salts in the formation water are not dissolved by the toluene, and, therefore, remain in the core sample. Subsequent to the Dean&Stark extraction the sample is placed in the soxhlet apparatus using methanol to remove salt deposits in the sample. The extracted water volume is corrected for salt content. correction factor for each depth zone is found using total water volume and total salt weight from all plugs covering each depth zone. Where: w b Cs = Distilled water density (g/cm3) = Brine density (g/cm3) = Dissolved salt concentration (g/l) The salt weight is the plug weight difference prior and after Methanol extraction. Density of brine is based on all salt being NaCl (Sodium Cloride). Complete removal of hydrocarbons was confirmed by visual checking the solvent discoloration, and by examine the sample using UV light. Chemical checks, using Silver Nitrate solution, were made to ensure that all salt had been removed. The samples were dried at 60 0C, for 48 hours and the weight recorded. Restricted 18No tracer was added to the mud fluids offshore therefore there is no invasion corrections performed in the fluid saturation calculations for this well. Porosity measurements on Sw plugs are performed as for routine plugs. Brine density value used in calculation is g/cc The value is based on plug weigth before and after methanol cleaning. Results from Dean&Stark fluid saturation analysis are listed in Appendix of this report.

The whole core length (except seal peels) was slabbed into tree parts (A, and cut). B-cut of the total cored interval is mounted in plastic trays and casted in epoxy. 11 BASIC PETROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES 11.1 Analysis overview The 1 horizontal core plugs (Offshore sampled) underwent the following laboratory procedures:  Hot shot Cleaning by hot Soxhlet solvent extraction (Toluene).  Hot Oven Drying at 600C .  Ambient He porosity and Empirical Klinkenberg corrected gas permeability measurements at 20 bar net confining pressure.  Grain and bulk volume measurements.  Final Cleaning by hot Soxhlet solvents extraction (Toluene, Methanol). The 1.5 vertical core plugs (Offshore sampled) underwent the following laboratory  Dean&Stark extraction in Toluene for water saturation analysis. Restricted 2111.2 CCA Laboratory Procedures For Basic Petrophysical Tests 11.2.1 Hot Shot Permeability, Porosity and Grain Density Weatherford lab was requested to provide hotshot porosity, Grain Density and permeability data from the following cores: 5, and 7. This involved drilling one horisontal 1 sample every metre out at the wellsite using oil as a lubricant. The priority plugs were trimmed, and then placed in hot soxhlet extractors for 12 to 24 hours (in toluene followed by methanol). Drying was carried out in conventional oven, at 60C for approximately 12 hours. Hot Shot Porosity and permeability were then measured as for routine plugs. After priority measurements the samples were included in the routine program, following the cleaning and analysis program as for routine plugs. NOTE: Analysis results from priority measurements are not included in this report but reported to customer immediately after analysis. 11.2.2 Cleaning and drying of plugs used for conventional core analysis All samples were cleaned in hot soxhlet extractor using methanol and toluene. Chemical and visual checks were made to ensure complete removal of fluids and salt. Then the core plugs were dried in hot oven at 60 for 48 hours prior to analysis. Restricted 22Core analysis well 16/2-14 T2 11.2.3 Helium porosity and grain density on CCA plugs Grain volume was measured in helium porosimeter on the cleaned and dried core plug using Boyles law to reference volume. Boyles law: When the temperature remaines constant, the volume of given mass of ideal gas varies inversely with its absolute pressure. Extention of the equation to account for temperature variation and nonideal gas behavior is required for accurate grain volume determination The method is direct measurement of Grain Volume using helium gas expansion porosimeter. Prior to measurements, the porosimeter was calibrated. This is done by performing standard measuring sequence using various combinations of steel-plugs with known volumes. Based on these measurements, function for grain volume is calculated from P1/ P2 : The calibration equation is determined by linear regression (last squares method) of disc volumes versus P1/ P2 Grain volume = + * P1/ P2 Porosity and pore volume are then calculated from grain volume and bulk volume. Bulk volume was measured by immersing the sample in mercury (the weight balance/ buoyancy technique). The dry weight of the core plug divided by grain volume gives grain density of the core plug. Number of plugs and results from the analysis are listed in Appendix D. Restricted 2311.2.4 Empirical Klinkenberg corrected gas permeability on CCA plugs Gas permeability was determined by flowing nitrogen gas through the cleaned and dried samples. At steady state conditions, the gas flow rate, the pressure drop over the plug sample and the upstream pressure were recorded. The confining pressure applied during the measurement was 20 bar. Ambient temperature was applied during the measurements. The gas permeability Kg was calculated using Darcy's law. The Klinkenberg corrected permeability value, Kl, was determined empirically, based on the measured Kg and the corresponding average pore pressure, Pm. Empirical Klinkenberg correction: 1. Kg range 0-2.0 mD Kl = Kg1.06 2. Kg range - mD Iteration loop Kl1 = Kg1.06 m1 = Kl10.61 Kl2 = Kg - m1/Pm m2 = Kl20.61 Kl3 = Kg - m2/Pm which gives: Kln+1 = Kg - mn/Pm When Kln+1 - Kln is approx. 0, then Kln+1 is approx. Kl. Two iterations are found to give proper result, giving Kl3 = Kl Symbols: Kg : Measured permeability to gas, Nitrogen Kl : Klinkenberg corrected gas permeability m : Klinkenberg correction (gas slippage effect).
