Premium grade Wyoming bentonite (bulk.) 2. Caustic Soda. 1.3 Drilling fluid procedure. 1. The drill water should be checked for total hardness and pH. These properties should then be adjusted to maximize the hydration of the bentonite clay. 2. Mix 71-85 kg/m3 (25-30 ppb) Wyoming Bentonite to the drill water and allow 6-10 hours to hydrate. 3. The pilot hole and the opening of the hole should be drilled with seawater, and at each connection high viscosity mud pill (+100 sec/qt) should be pumped to optimize hole cleaning (5m3 minimum). 4. The hole should be displaced with spud mud in pre- paration to run and receive 30 casing.2.0 26 Hole. Depth in Funnel viscosity 50 - 70 sec/qt. Mud weight sp.gr. 2.1 Drilling fluid recommendation.

Premium grade Wyoming bentonite. 2.3 Drilling fluid procedure. 1. Prior to drilling out the 30 casing shoe, 240 m3 (1500 bbls) of gel mud should be built, consisting of Wyoming bentonite and treated drilled water (ref. chapter 1.3.1) 2. The 30 casing shoe should be drilled with seawater. This is necessary to offset the effects of drilling cement. 3. The pilot hole should be drilled and underreamed to 26 with the gel mud. Seawater dilution should be used, as needed, to maintain the desired mud weight and viscosity. Prehydrated bentonite should be used if an increase in viscosity is needed. 4. It may be desirable to sweep the hole with high viscosity pill prior to running and receiving 20 casing.Page 10 3.0 17 1/2 Hole. Depth Mud Weight 900m - 1715m - sp.gr.

Make up 128 m3 polymer premix of drill water The premix should be made up in the following concentrations and order: a) ppb Milpolymer 302 b) ppb Drispac Reg.Page 11 2. Mix ppb Permalose together with 128 m3, 90 ppb KC1-brine. This brine shall be mixed together with the 128 m3 polymer premix to make up 256 m3 45 ppb KC1 - polymer system. Adjust the pH to - by the use of liquid Caustic Soda. After the fluid is mixed together adjust the rheology if necessary by addition of Milpolymer 302. 3. Drill out the cement in the 20 casing and the rat hole with mud left in the hole and seawater dumping all returns. No seawater should be allowed to come into contact with KC1-polymer fluid in the shaker deck pits. 4. Displace the hole to KCl - polymer fluid. (requires approx. 175 m3 which will leave 155 m3 fluid on the surface). 3.4 Daily maintenance of drilling fluid. For daily maintenance of KCl-polymer fluid it is essential that the rig solids control equipment work at peak efficiency. However, it is expected that large quantities of whole-mud dilution will be necessary to maintain the fluids integrity and achieve desired mud specifications while drilling. The mixing of individual products direct to the active system should be avoided. Necessary adjustments to mud properties should be made first to the premix. Under no circumstances is seawater to be added to this system. 1. KC1 - The KC1 is to be maintained at concentration of approx. 45 lb/bbl for maximum inhibition of swelling clays. While drilling, the KC1 concentration will be adjusted as formation dictates.Page 12 2. Rheology - The Y.P. (Yield point) should be maintained in the range of 10-15 pascal to achieve maximum hole cleaning. Milpolymer 302 is blend of Xanthan gum and guar gum and is used as the primary viscosifier in the system. The shear thinning characteristics of Milpolymer 302 results in minimum viscosities at high shear rates, but once the shear rate is reduced, the fluid regains viscosity and structure to enhance the hole cleaning capability. Dilution with drill water and/or whole mud will be necessary to control excessive rheological properties. No bentonite should be used in this system. 3. A.P.I. Fluid Loss - Troughout the section the A.P.I. fluid loss shall be maintained at level of 8-10 cc. Drispac Regular and Superb should be used to control the A.P.I. fluid loss at this level. These polyanionic synthetic products provide thin tough filter cake. It may however be difficult to obtain this low fluidloss initially when the fluid contains little or no barite or drillsolids. An initial fluidloss less than 10 cc is therfore not necessary. The initial amount of polymer added to the system shall be dictated by rheological properties and not by the initial fluid loss 4. Mud Weight - Adjustment to mud weight will be dictated by pore pressures and/or hole problems, and made only after consultation and approval of Norsk Hydro representative. 5. Encapsulation - Drispac have secondary function as protective colloid to reduce dispersion of sensitive shale formations. This function also enhances better solids removal to provide cleaner drilling fluid. 6. Solids Control - Screens for the primary shale shakers and mud cleaners should be of the smallest possible mesh that will tolerate the elevated flow rates anticipated in this section. Solids control equipment will be used to the maximum extent possible in order to minimize the build up of drill solids in the system. Dilution should only be with drillwater and the dilution amounts will be monitored at all times.Page 13 The centrifuge should also be used to recover the expensive KC1-polymer fluid phase when needed. 7. M.B.T. - should be maintanined at less than 15 ppb bentonite equivalent. The inhibited nature and encapsulation effect of this system along with optimized solids control and whole mud dilution should be used to ensure M.B.T. level below 15 ppb. This is impreative to the success of the KCl-polymer system. 8. pH - Liquid Caustic Soda should be used to maintain to pH. 9. Product additions - The mixing of individual polymer products through the chemical hopper should be avoided if possible. Necessary adjustments to mud properties using these products should be made by prehydrating the polymers in premix and then bleeding it into the active system. All additions of Caustic Soda should be by the use of Liquid NaOH.Page 14 4.0. 12 1/4 Hole Depth : 1750 - 2665 Mud Weight : - sg. Funnel Viscosity : 45 - 60 sec./gt.

Treat or dump any cement contaminated mud. 4.4 Daily maintenance of drilling fluid. For daily maintenance of KC1-polymer fluid it is essential that the rig solids control equipment work at peak efficiency. However, it is expected that large quantities of whole-mud dilution will be necessary to maintain the fluids integrity and achieve desired mud specifications while drilling. The mixing of individual products direct to the active system should be avoided. Necessary adjustments to mud properties should be made first to the premix. Under no circumstances is seawater to be added to this system.Page 15 1. The KCl concentration will be adjusted as formation dictates. Frequently in and out mudcheck should indicate the KCl concentration needed. the range of 10-12 pascal to achieve maximum hole 3. A.P.I. Fluid Loss - Drispac Regular and Superb should be used to control the A.P.I. fluid loss less than 10 cc throughout this section.

M.B.T. - should be maintanined al less than 15 ppb 10. H2 Gas - The Garrett Gas Train should be run every 100 in the 12 1/4 and 1/2 section or per Norsk Hydro's order. The results should be put on the daily mud report.Page 17 5.0 1/2 hole Depth Mud weight Funnel Viscosity Yield point API Water loss HTHP Water loss MET pH C1 5.1 Drilling : 2650 - 3750 1.70 Sq. 60 - 70 sec/qt 5-8 Pascal 4-6 cc Less than 15 cc at 160C As low as possible 9.5 - 50 00 mg/1 mud recommendation.

Make up total of 300 m3 fluid. The fluid shall be mixed in the following order: Prepare the mg/1 Cl- by mixing 107 m3 of 140.000 mg/1 Cl-brine with 143 m3 of drillwater. 2. Add to the mg/1 Cl-brine ppb Kemseal at rate of 15-20 min. per sack. If foaming should occure, add some Prodefoamer.Page 18 3. Add - ppb XCD-Polymer at rate of 10 min. per seck. Shear the fluid for 1/2 - hour. 4. By addition of liquid Caustic Soda raise the pH to 9.5 - 10.0. Shear the fluid for another 1/2 - hour. 5. Add barite to increase the fluid density to s.g. 6. Add kg/m3 Proxygen to the system. 5.4. Daily maintenance of the drilling fluid. For daily maintenance of NaCl-polymer fluid it is peak efficiency. The mixing of individual products direct to the active system should be avoided. Necessary premix. 1. The Cl- is to be maintained at concentration of approx. 60000 mg/1 for balancing formation cloride contents. While drilling, the Cl- concentration will be adjusted as formation dictates. the range of 5-8 pascal to achieve maximum hole cleaning. Kemseal and XCD-Polymer will both contribute to viscosity and Yield Point. The shear thinning characteristics of these polymers will result in minimum viscosity with high shear rates at the bit and as shear rates is reduced in annulus the fluid will regain viscosity and structure to enhance the hole cleaning. As temperature increases, XCD polymer will start to degrade. At this stage, when degradation starts, sufficient amounts of drill solids has entered the system and will together with Kemseal provide gel structures to support the barite.Use of Miltemp will be necessary to control excessive rheological properties. No bentonite should be used in this system.Page 19 3. A.P.I. Fluid Loss - Prior to displacing the hole the mud system should be mixed to maintain an A.P.I. fluid loss as low as possible. When drilling starts and drill solids enters the system, the fluid loss shall be reduced to less than cc and shall be maintained at this level by the use of KEM-SEAL. HTHP fluid loss shall be controlled to be less than 15 cc at 160C. 5. Solids Control - Screens for the primary shale shakers 6. M.B.T. - should be maintanined as low as possible. Whole mud dilution along with optimized solids control should be used to ensure M.B.T. level as low as possible. 7. pH - Liquid Caustic Soda should be used to maintain 8.

However, as safety precaution Promud A/S suggests H2S gas check to be done every 100 in of drilled hole in the 12 1/4 section or per Norsk Hydro's order. This test will be done using the Garrett Gas Train. Also, as safety measure a ppb minimum stock of Milgard 1125 gas scavenger should be on the rig. 7.2 Loss Circulation - Mud volumes and mud returns should be monitored at all times. Should loss circu- lation occur and the need arise, viscous LCM pill may be spotted at the loss zone. selection of various size loss circulation materials should be available on the rig. 7.3 Standby materials.

KEM-SEAL reduces both API and HT/HP fluid loss and is extremely thermally stable. It is tolerant of divalent cations and functions in the normal pH range of drilling muds (7 to 11 pH). APPLICATION KEM-SEAL can be used to supplement existing fluid loss additives in any water base mud as they are affected by increasing temperatures and thermally degrade. KEM-SEAL also can be used as the polymer base for high temperat- ure mud with other additives such as MILTEMP and T. CLAY. RECOMMENDED TREATMENT As required. Normal dose levels will be from to lb/bbl depending on degree of fluid loss required, make up water and bottom hole temper- atures. TYPICAL PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Form - light tan granules.
