VSP Deconvolution The Rig Source VSP data was acquired by READ Well Services on the 7th and 8th of November 1993 in two run; Run from 3287-1710 MD RICE and Run from 3216-2060 MD RKB. The seismic source employed for the survey was two Sleeve Guns with total volume of 300 cu in, depth and air pressure 2000 psi. The near field monitor hydrophone was kept at an offset of 1.0 m. Further details are to be found in section Field Operations Report. The receiver array in Run consisted of main tool and satellites, each containing component geophone cartridge. Thus levels were acquired simultaneously. Only the upper two satellites were used in Run be- cause the arm was removed from the lower satellite. Thus only three levels were acquired simulta- neously. Run was used in this VSP processing because it overlapped Run 2. The following shows Saga Petroleum a.s. 34/7-A-6 H, R.S. VSP Pagethe spacing during the Runl Rig Source VSP Survey: From Interval To Editing, stacking and timing of data The component geophone data was displayed at large scale and each component edited. The in- dividual near field monitor records were timed to the main peak, and the corresponding geophone traces shifted by this time. It was found that this system delay was stable at 17 +/-1 ms for the Rig Source VSP. The raw traces at each level for the VSP were aligned by maximizing the cross cor- relation inside window (50 ms) after the first arrival. The data is resampled to 1/4 ms for this pur- pose. The Rig Source VSP data was then stacked using median algorithm. summary of the traces included in the stacks at each level on Runl and Run2, the system delays and residual align- ment delays are contained in the' Stack Report' (Section 4). The first arrival time was taken as the max of the first peak: this corresponds to 'trough-to-trough' picking. The reader is refered to Appendix 1: First Arrival Picking for full discussion of this pro- cess. Four check shot levels were recorded on the way down. total of 159 levels were recorded on the  Run Rig Source VSP and all of them were used in the further VSP processing. Data in the interval 0 MD RICE was used in the Rig Source VSP. Fig 1. is an outline of the pre stack processing sequence up to Raw stacks described above. TRANSMISSION LOSS COMPENSATION Energy loss of the direct arrival is compensated for by normalizing the data in 40 ms window after the first arrival. single scalar is applied to each trace to force the RMS amplitude in this window to unity.Fig 1: R.S.

Since the tool orientation downhole is unknown, the same is valid for the hl and h2 ori- entation. To be able to process the two horizontal components they have to be rotated to fixed coordinate system. In the horizontal plane X-Y (hl-h2), the angle information derived from the analysis is used for rotation of the data to Radial (HR) and Transverse (HT) component. The Radial component is pointing towards the transmitted P-wave. Transverse component is pointing 90 deg. to the radial component. Both components are in the horizontal plane. In the vertical planes Z-X and Z-Y, the angle of incidence for the vertical component of the trans- mitted P-wave can be measured. After rotation of the two horizontal components X-Y (hl-h2), toa radial (HR) and transverse (I-F1) component in the horizontal plane, the angle of incidence for the vertical component of the transmitted P-wave is found in the Z-HR plane. This angle information is used to rotate the and HR Component to plane which contains max transmitted P-wave energy. This plane is called the Source-Receiver plane, and is vertical plane. The Radial Component in this Vertical Plane (ZR) is defined to point towards the transmitted P- wave, while the Transverse Component (Zr) is pointing 90 deg to the Radial Component. Fig 2. Three component rotations. Since the Radial component in the Source-Receiver plane (ZR) contains all the transmitted P-wave energy, the transmission loss for the transmitted P-wave are calculated from this component. A window along the first break line with length of 40 ins is chosen. All components are then com- pensated for the P-wave transmission loss (Display BG1). WAVEFIELD SEPARATION The transmitted P-wave was estimated from the Radial component (ZR) in the Source-Receiver plane, and the transmitted S-wave was estimated from the Transverse Component (ZT). The P- downwaves were enhanced by using point median filter (Display BG2, Panel and subtracted from the ZR component (Display BG3, Panel A). The S-downwaves were enhanced by using 11 Point Median Filter (Display BG2, Panel D) and subtracted from the ZT Component (Display BG3, Panel D). After removing the downgoing P- and S-waves the two components (ZR and ZT) were inverse ro-tated back to the true Vertical (Z) (Display BG3, Panel E) and Horizontal (HR) Component (Dis- play BG3, Panel F). To extract the reflected P- and S- waves the two components (Z,HR) were rotated stepwise with 15 degrees' steps (Display TG1 and TG2). The maximum reflected P-wavefield was extracted by ro- tating the Transverse Component linearly from 45 -30 degrees (Display BG4, Panel A), starting with 45 degrees at the top of the dataset and ending with 30 degrees at the bottom. The maximum reflected S-wavefield was extracted by rotating the Radial Component linearly from 20-10 degrees (Display BG4a, Panel A). Residual reflected S-wavefield was removed from the maximum reflect- ed P-wavefield by 15 point median filter. Residual reflected P-wavefield was removed from the maximum reflected S-wavefield by 15 point median filter. P- & S-WAVE ENHANCEMENT The P-waves were NMO-Corrected (DisplayBG4, Panel B) and enhanced with point dip adap- five median filter with dip pass zone -0.0664/0.014 ms/m and dips to scan ( Display BG4, Panel C). The NMO-Correction was then removed from the dataset (Display BG4, Panel D). The S-waves were picked and aligned and then enhanced with point dip adaptive median filter with dip pass zone -0.0525/0.0105 ms/m and dips (Display BG4a, Panel C). VSP DECONVOLUTION An inverse filter was calculated from the estimated downgoing P-wavefield (7 points enhancement) on the ZR component. The deconvolution was done trace by trace apart from traces 56-69 which were substituted by stack of traces 74-79 and traces 90-119 which were substituted by stack of trac- es 148-153. Both Minimum phase and Zero phase operator was applied on the enhanced reflected P-wave (Display BG4, panel E/F) and on the enhanced reflected S-wave (Display BG4a, Panel E/ F). Desired output was bandpass filter 7(18) - 100(24) Hz(dB/Oct). SPHERICAL DIVERGENCE COMPENSATION The loss of energy due to spherical divergence is compensated for by applying the scalar Si to sam- ple i, where Si = (Ti / TO) ** and Ti is the time of sample i, TO the first arrival time, and data dependant parameter in the range to 1.5, in this case 1.4. The scalar is chosen on experience with VSP's in the Snorre area. REGRIDDING AND FILTERING OF THE DATASET The dataset (P-wave) was regridded to in the NMO-domain and then filtered (P- and S- wave) with 7(18)-50/80(24) Hz (dB/Oct) Zero Phase Bandpass Filter (Display BG5-BG8, Panel E/F).

VSP PageFINITE DIFFERENCE (X,F) MIGRATION The P-wave data was migrated with X,F migration algorithm.The finite difference depth migra- tion algorithm is Pre-stack Migration (shot record migration) algorithm. By assuming reciprocity, i.e. interchanging the source and receivers, the receiver wavefield is back-propagated from the sur- face. Modelling of the source wavefield is delayed until extrapolation of the receiver field reaches the depth at which the receiver is located. The current algorithms for anisotropy migration assume elliptical anisotropy. The vertical veloci- ties are kept unchanged from the modelling of the Normal Incidence VSP, and the estimates for the horisontal velocities are variated. The anisotropy effect compensation used here is 5%.

INTRODUCTION The two methods commonly employed to pick first arrival times from VSP data are 'trough-to-trough' and 'break-to-break' measurements. The terms trough and break refer to the part of the waveform on the near field monitor trace and the vertical component geophone trace which are picked. Both these methods have their supporters in oil com- panies, and both are justified by theoretical and practical considerations. The decision about which to use rests with the client, and will generally be based on company policy in this matter, the method used in nearby wells, and to some extent data quality. The soft- ware in use at READ Well Services allows both methods to be used.  Section outlines the theoretical problems about choice of first arrival picking method. It concludes that trough-to-trough measurements will probably give the best 'tie' be- tween the VSP and surface seismic data sets, due to the inescapable dispersive and ab- sorptive nature of the earth. From practical viewpoint alone, trough to trough picking is preferable for the following reasons: 1. The trough pick can be made with much greater accuracy, the timing of local mini- mum being virtually indisputable. 2. In the presence of noise, the trough pick is more easily recognizable. Though the pres- ence of noise can alter the timing of trough pick, this can usually be overcome by using an envelope function. 2.0 STANDARD PROCESSING SEQUENCE FOR FIRST ARRIVAL ESTIMATION 2.1 Editing The near field monitor traces and z-component geophone traces are read from field tape, displayed at large scale, and edited. Traces are edited because of: - Electrical noise contamination (50 / 60 Hz) - High frequency noise bursts - / ratio low - Poor clamping However it is important to preserve enough data to produce good stack. The median stacking routine is particularly robust in the presence of noise bursts. level can be com- pletely removed after FIB picking (as it is nearly always possible to estimate the Appendix : First Arrival Picking - Page of - Mod. 1/18/91Appendix : First Arrival Picking so that the bad trace does not affect adjacent levels during wavefield separation 2.2 Near Field Monitor timing There is small, potentially variable time delay from the start of data on tape and the seis- mic energy being released from the source. This is measured by recording near field monitor trace simultaneously with the geophone data. This, in the marine case, is hy- drophone kept at fixed distance from the airgun. The near field hydrophone is timed by a semi-automatic alogrithm. 2.3 Stack of geophone data Each geophone trace is sub-sample shifted by the value of the corresponding monitor time. The geophone data is now sorted into common level gathers. Optionally, the traces can be aligned by cross-correlation and sub-sample shift technique. The data is then stacked in common level gathers, using the normal average stack or optionally median algorithm. 2.4 Timing of geophone traces This process is done semi-interactively, using blown up view of the first arrival region. After picking is complete, there is optionally an automatic alignment process which can correct the first breaks by cross-correlation of each trace with pilot trace, or by numer- ical smoothing of the arrival times. 2.5 Use of first break information The first break times are transferred to the check shot software for use in producing the check shot report and calibration of the sonic log. The times are also transferred to the trace headers of the x- and y- geophone components, for use in further processing of three component data. 3.0 BREAK-TO-BREAK vs. TROUGH-TO-TROUGH: THEORY First consider the ideal seismic source: true impulse with flat amplitude spectrum and a zero or linear phase spectrum. The first break and the first trough are the same thing. This source is of course impossible to produce, but source with very short rise time (e.g. dynamite has relatively flat amplitude spectrum from - MO Hz.) approaches the ideal. The travel time the centre of this impulse characterizes the group velocity of the medium. With an airgun or watergun source, the leading peak of the main energy is also of relatively short duration.Due to the absorptive and dispersive properties of the earth, it is observed in most wells that the time between first break and first trough increases with depth. The first trough, however, still retains its meaning as travel time characteristic of the group velocity of the medium. The first break, however, will characterize the arrival of the various phase velocities. The position of the first break in time will depend on the amplitude and gain downhole. Higher frequencies will be detectable with higher gain. In the presence of broad band noise, detectability becomes yet more complex problem. 'Minimum phase' interpretation of surface seismic data deals essentially with breaks, though velocity analysis deals essentially with peaks and troughs (though at much lower resolution). The timing of identifiable events on the surface seismic will thus be break measurement. The 'tie' between the VSP and the surface seismic will depend on both data sets having the same temporal bandwidth. This can be arranged by using the same deconvolution and bandpass filter parameters on the VSP as were used on the surface seismic. If the surface seismic is 'zero phase', this will often mean, in the marine case, that some sort of phase correction process has been run on the data. similar process can be applied to the VSP data set. One important use of check shot data is the calibration of sonic logs. The sonic log is re- corded with single ultra-sonic sound pulse ( ca. 25 kHz. ), and the transit time measured by the signal crossing detection threshold. The threshold varies according to the signal- to-noise conditions at the receiver, and although some adjustment is made, the 'pick' is neither first break nor first trough. The single frequency means there will be no disper- sion, and there is relatively little absorption over the short travel path. The well geophone data includes possibly dispersive and certainly absorptive effect better estimated by the trough-to-trough method and not removed by picking break-to- break. Thus by calibrat- ing the sonic log with trough-to-though picked check shot values, the synthetic seismo- gram will have included in it the effects of dispersion and absorption. This will then tie well with the surface seismic data. Sonic derived interval velocities are often used for quite detailed formation analysis, and in these cases it is wise to investigate the way in which the sonic log has been calibrated.Appendix: VSP Deconvolution DECONVOLUTION DURING VSP PROCESSING 1.0 SOURCE SIGNATURE DECONVOLUTION In some situations it may be necessary to perform source signature deconvolution on the data set before stack. This occurs when there is significant variation in the source signa- ture from shot to shot, caused by large variations in gun depth, variation in the pressure of the air supplied to the gun, or with sources consisting of several guns, failure of the synchronization system. In these situations, the geophone traces will be potentially dis- similar, and cannot be stacked without severe loss of signal quality. Source signature deconvolution is performed by designing filter which shapes each near field hydrophone signal into suitable standard output wavelet (e.g. bandlimited spike), and applying this filter to the corresponding geophone trace. Another technique which can be applied to cases where the source signature varies, but is still essentially minimum phase, is predictive deconvolution using window from the geophone trace alone. Software for performing both these types of deconvolution is in available at RWS. It should be noted that the near field hydrophone data is usually not of the same quality as the geophone data. The severe operating environment requires an instrument built for robustness rather than high fidelity. The signal is also dominated by high frequencies which do not penetrate the earth to the geophones. Hence it is recommended to employ a gun flotation system, good air supply, and reliable gun control system to ensure re- peatable source signature. Then the source signature may be removed from the data to- gether with downgoing multiples during the VSP deconvolution process. 2.0 VSP DECONVOLUTION In order to remove the downgoing multiple response and source signature from the up- going wavefield, there are two main options available: Deterministic deconvolution: This is applicable to zero offset, vertical incidence, and with less accuracy to offset geometries. The assumption is that measured upgoing wave- field is the convolution of the reflection series beneath the geophone with the downgoing wavefield measured at the geophone. Thus if we design filter which collapses the mea- sured downgoing wavefield to bandlimited spike, applying the filter to the measured up- going wavefield will produce the bandlimited reflection coefficient series beneath the geophone. The window input to the Wiener filter will be chosen to include significant multiples. In the case of offset geometries, the main assumption made above is invalid, as the downgoing energy has different ray-path to the upgoing at given receiver. How- ever, as many of the multiples are in fact short period and generated in the near surface Appendix : VSP Deconvolution - Page of - Mod. 2/16/90Appendix : VSP Deconvolution region, where the ray paths are not significantly different, applying deterministic decon- volution with short input window may prove effective. An alternative is predictive deconvolution. This process, while effective on surface seis- mic data, is for VSP inferior to the deterministic method described above. This is because no assumptions are made in the deterministic method about the nature of the source or the reflectors. In predictive deconvolution, the assumptions made are that the reflection series is 'white', and that the source signature is minimum phase. The method is applica- ble to situations where the up- and downgoing ray paths differ significantly, and may be used in combination with deterministic approach. Software to perform both these types of deconvolution, together with an sophisticated wavelet analysis package, are available at RWS. The software is sufficiently flexible to allow deconvolution operators to be designed, processed independently and stored for use as required in either other stages of the VSP processing, or on other data sets. RWS has experience in the reprocessing of surface seismic data employing VSP derived de- convolution operators.

The last ( trace ) data record in each file is followed by an EOF mark. The last file on tape is fol- lowed by multiple EOF marks, Reel Identification Header The reel header consists of two records, one 3200 byte record of text in EBCDIC code, in theform of forty 80-charcater 'cards' and one 400 byte record of binary coded information. The EBCDIC header contains text describing the data. The binary coded data has the following format ( only re- corded information is listed ) : Binary code - Right justified Byte Nos. : Contents 13 - 14 : Number of data traces per record 15 - 16 : Number of auxiliary traces per record 17 - 18 : Sample interval in microseconds ( for this SEGY file ): 19 - 20 : Sample interval in microseconds ( for original field recording ) 21 - 22 : Number of samples per data trace ( for this SEGY file ) 23 - 24 : Number of samples per data trace ( for original field recording ) 25 - 26 Data sample format code ( = byte floating point ) 27 - 28 : CDP Fold 29 - 30 : Trace sorting code 31 - 32 : Vertical sum code ( = No sum )Trace Identification Header Each trace data recol rd consists of 240 byte trace header followed by the trace data. The trace header has the following binary coded format ( only recorded information is listed ) 1 - : Trace sequence no. within line 5 - : Trace sequence no. within SEGY file ('reel') 9 - 12 : Original Field record no. 13 - 16 : Trace no. within original field record 21 - 24 : CDP ensemble no, 25 - 28 : Trace no. within GDP ensemble 29 - 30 : Trace identification code ( = Seismic data ) 31 - 32 : No. of vertically summed traces yielding this trace : No. of samples in this trace : Sample interval in microseconds for this trace The traces data following the trace header is in code defined by bytes 25 - 26 of the binary reel header record.SEG-Y TAPE CONTENTS READ WELL SERVICES A/S SEGY RAW DATA TAPE Client : Saga Petroleum a.s.
