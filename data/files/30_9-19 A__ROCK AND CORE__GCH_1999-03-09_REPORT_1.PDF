Approved by Bjorg Andresen 1999-03-09 *9 6r1d1C4111 Introduction One gas sample from well 6406/2-4SR, test and one sample from well 30/9-19A, test are analysed for gas and isotopic composition. On the samples C1 - C5 and CO2 are quantified and the 813C value is measured on methane, ethane, propane, the butanes and CO2. In addition the SD value is measured on methane. 2 Analytical procedures Aliquots of ml are sampled with syringe for analysis on Poraplot column connected with flame ionisation (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. The detection limit for the hydrocarbon gas components is g1/m1 and for H2S and for CO2 0.2 ,l/ml. Two different approaches are used for the isotopic determination. For the isotope analysis of methane and carbon dioxide 5-10 ml of the gas is sampled with syringe and then separated into the different gas components by Carlo Erba 4200 gas chromatograph. Methane is oxidised in CuO-oven. The combustion products CO2 and H20 are frozen into collection vessels and separated. Carbon dioxide is collected directly after the chromatographic separation. The combustion water is reduced with zinc metal in sealed quarts tubes to prepare hydrogen for isotopic analysis. The isotopic measurements are performed on VG Optima and Finnigan Delta mass spectrometer. For the carbon isotopic determination of the wet gas components aliquots are sampled with a syringe and analysed on VG Isochrom connected on line to VG Optima Mass spectrometer. HP 5890 II with Poraplot column is used for the separation and helium is used as carrier gas. The injections are performed in splitless mode. Both analytical methods are tested with the same laboratory gas mixture. Based on repeated analysis of the gas mixture, the reproducibility in the 813C value is better than 0.5%o PDB in both methods. The reproducibility in the SD value is likewise better than 10%0.3 Results The normalised volume composition of the gas samples is shown in Table 1. No I-12S is detected in the samples. The stable isotope composition is shown in Table 2. The molecular composition related to the carbon isotope variation in methane from the samples are plotted in Figure (Schoell, 1983), the carbon and hydrogen variation in methane are plotted in Figure (Schoell, 1983) and the carbon isotope variation in ethane related to the carbon isotope variation in methane in Figure (Schoell, 1983).

These primary gases may become mixed and form various mixtures of intermediate composition. TT(m) and Tr(h) are non-associated gases from marine source rocks and coal gases from N.W. Germany, respectively. Compositional shifts due to migration are indicated by arrows Md (deep migration) and Ms (shallow migration), respectively. To are gases associated with petroleum in an initial phase of formation. To are gases associated with condensates (Schoen, 1983).8D methane o/oo SMOW -300 -250 -200 -150 -100  Figure Carbon and hydrogen variations in methane in gas samples from well 6406/2-4SR and well 30/9-19A formation.
