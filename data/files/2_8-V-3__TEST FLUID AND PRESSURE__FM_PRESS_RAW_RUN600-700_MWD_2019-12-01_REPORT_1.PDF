Six (6) pressure test took place during pumps-on and pumps-off in Run600 and Four (4) in Run 700. The entire Pressure Transient Analysis presented in this document is based on High Resolution Pressure Data from the Quartz Gauge measurement. Manual pressure criteria applied to each pressure transient. In addition to the GeoTap, Run 600 & Run 700s Bottom Hole Assembly also contain Dual Gamma Ray(DGR), Azimuthal Deep Resistivity(ADR), Azimuthal Litho Density(ALD), Compensated Thermal Neutron(CTN) and EarthStarTM (ES) tools.

This causes the pressure pulse called pretest drawdown. The combination off low rate and snorkel determines an effective range of operation. The maximum drawdown pressure pulse can be determined from the well- known spherical flow equation where dPdd is the final drawdown pressure differential at time t=oo.

Exact Mobility Analysis By analyzing the drawdown curve and the build-up curve it is possible to calculate the mobility of the formation. The mobility is defined as the permeability divided by the viscosity (md/cp). Therefore if the viscosity of the fluid being drawn is known, it is also possible to determine the formation permeability. The fluid being drawn into the pretest is normally assumed to be the mud filtrate so if the mud type is known it is possible to estimate the filtrate viscosity. The two methods of determining the mobility are shown by the two equations below. First is the drawdown mobility Mdd that uses the drawdown pressure differential (i.e.,dPdd=Pstop-Pdd_end) and is the most common method used in the industry. It is normally referred to as the steady-state spherical method. The second is the exact spherical mobility Mexact that typically uses the buildup curve. simplified form of the exact method is shown in Figure-1 which is an exponential with magnitude of (pressure, psi) and time constant of a(sec). Both the drawdown and buildup curves can be analyzed but normally the buildup is used. The curve fit parameters alpha and beta f are used to determine the mobility. Generally these Mdd and Mexact are very similar except in low mobility zones where the mobility is < md/cp. In this case the Exact method yields the most accurate estimate of Mobility. 14,696 q Z o Mdd=  ____________   Drawdown spherical mobility (md/cp) 2,r  OP dd   -A 14,696   Z tp o ____    1-  fi  rp   2f Exact spherical mobility (md/cp) dtp.................................................................draw down production time(tdd_end-tdd_start ,sec) a......................................................................................Exact curve fit time constant (sec) f................................................................................Exact curve fit build up constant (psi)Suite 10-01&10-02, Lvl.10 Tower, 199 Jalan Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur December 2019 Confidential Page 61 Pressure (psi) Phyds Q tdd tdd_start Pdd_start  t Pbu(t)P  f* e Pstop t =  tdd_end Pdd=Pstop-Pdd_end Pdd_end tdd_end Time (sec) tstop T Fig1 Buildup function where formation pressure (Pf*), Alpha ( ) and beta () are determined from the Exact curve fit and Pf* is normally reported PExaxt.Confidential Page 62 Test Quality Parameters There are two different measurements of test quality. The first is called the sigma which is measure of how closely the data conforms to the Exact model and is reported in  pressure units (normally psi). The sigma is determined by calculating the standard deviation of the data from the theoretical curve as follows. 6(Pbu ) = ~ - (pi()(Pi))2 bu (n-1) ...........standard deviation  pressure units (normally psi) Pbu...........................................................buildup pressure from Exact curve fit (see Fig. 1) p(i).............................................................................................measured buildup pressures i...............................................................................................................index of data point n..................................................................................total number of pressure points used The second method of measuring the test quality is the pressure and temperature stability. The Pressure Stability and Temperature Stability are determined using linear regression over the time period specified (i.e., default of 30 sec) and reported for each selected stop pressure. The stability can be either positive or negative. The stability period can be modified if desired in RTS. The source data for this derivative is the pressure gauge selected by the engineer for formation pressure which is normally the Quartz gauge closest to the probe. There are some exceptions to the stability period during buildups which are outlined below. 1. Start of buildup continue stability calculation until the buildup time reaches the stability period (i.e., 30 default). 2. Reset stability period to 1/3 of the buildup time (10 seconds default). 3. As the buildup progresses increase the stability period using 1/3 of the buildup time until the specified stability time is reached (30 sec default).Confidential Page 63 Manual Pressure Test Criteria As per agreement with AkerBP, manual pressure criteria was applied to each transient analysis.

No Seal Transient shows no drawdown evident. Lost Seal Transient shows drawdown and possibly to build-ups proceeds to fair stability and is then lost. Premature return to Hydrostatic pressure.Confidential Page 64 Flow Rate Determination There are three methods of determining the drawdown (and pumping) flow rates which can be selected in the Job Parameters. In the newer tools the flow rate is measured and the Automatic Method is the preferred default. In older tools the flow rate or test volume can be specified but the values must be entered manually. With any of these three options it is rare that the volumes and rates exactly match that specified by the engineer since there is variability in the actual execution of pretest and the rates and volume in RTS are determined from actual events and measured data. Automatic Flow Rate Option The automatic flow rate option determines rate from the measured rate curve(s) directly. For pretesting the averaged rate between the selected starting and ending times of the drawdown is used (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd). It is possible to select Tend_dd that may not fall within the drawdown period and still estimate the mobility using the averaged rate for the drawdown period chosen. When this happens the simulated drawdown curve is turned off. For both pumping and pretesting the rate should be determined from the active rate curves. Since some tools like the RDT can have more than one pretest module or pump the total average from all the rate curves are used to for the Automatic Rate calculation. Then the volume for the drawdown is determined by using this averaged rate times the drawdown time (i.e., AvgRate/(Tend_dd-Tstart_dd)). However, the time used to average should not exceed 30 minutes which would apply to pumpouts or miniDST testing and it is desirable to determine the rate just prior to the buildup. In this case the averaged rate would be from Tdd-30 minutes to Tdd. Also, rates less than cc/sec from Meas PT Rate are filtered out (set to values) and rates less than cc/sec for Pump Rates are set to before averaging. Manual Flow Rate Option With this option selection in the Job Parameters the rate is fixed to the value entered. The volume of the pretest is determined by multiplying this rate time the drawdown time period selected (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd). Manual Volume Option With this option selection in the Job Parameters the volume is fixed to the value entered. The rate of the pretest is determined by dividing this volume by the drawdown time period selected (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd).Suite 10-01&10-02, Lvl.10 Tower, 199 Jalan Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur Confidential RTS Mobility Drawdown and Buildup Calculation Summary 1 December 2019 Page 65 Table PTA Spherical Flow Regime Calculations (Typical Physical Units) Mdd= 14,696        2 O dd  Ms exact= Mloglog Mfast= 14,696  Qo 2,r /3   14,696 4      Zp rp 1.5 Vo      cf 2.5  dp dt 14,696  c 4 fast Msphere= 14,696   cf    4msphere     e -tp a 1.5  ..........
