Personnel Flow ChartOBJECTIVE Well 6507/7-4 The prime objective of this well is to establish the oil/water contact in the middle Jurassic sand, the top of which is located at approximately 2455m.ANTICIPATED DRILLING PROBLEMS 1. Well 6507/12-2 had problems with shallow gas prior to setting the 20 casing. They had drilled and reamed the hole with ppg mud. After displacing the riser with seawater they started out of the hole. While pulling the last stand of drill collars the well blew mud and cuttings past the crown. The well was shut in but gas began leaking at the 30 casing shoe. Attempts were made to kill the well by bullheading mud into the well but this was unsuccessful so drill collars were stripped into the hole. Large amounts of LCM was pumped in to shut off the leak at the 30 shoe but it was necessary to use batches of cement (1400 sacks) before shut off was obtained. The cement was drilled out and the 20 casing run. It was reported that the hole was not filled when pulling the last three stands and this loss in hydrostatic pressure was sufficient for the well to be in an underbalanced condition and flow. Keeping the hole full on trips is basic necessity and must be complied with to minimize the problems with shallow gas when it is present in an area. 2. There are potential problems of gumbo and shale influx while drilling the 17h hole. These problems can be reduced by controlling the ph of the drilling mud between and 9.5, using an inhibitive mud system, keeping annular velocities as high as possible to keep the hole clean, controlling trip time to reduce swabbing when pulling the bit and the piston effect when running the bit back into the hole. Solids control equipment is to be maintained and operated so maximum efficiency can be achieved in removing the large amounts of drill solids from the mud. 3. Wells 6507/7-1 & had problems with boulders while drilling the 36 hole. In 6507/7-1 an arm was torn off of the 36 hole opener and left in the hole. The junk was never encountered as drilling continued. Boulders can also cause deviation problems which can be critical in the wellhead area. Problems can be minimized while drilling 36 hole by monitoring torque and bit weight closely, by using 36 stabilizer close to the bit, and by reaming on connections. Two 36 hole openers should be kept on the rig as back-up.GENERAL INFORMATION Well Name: 6507/7-4 Projected TD: 2850m Location: Latitude 65o 19' Longitude 07 15' UTM = 4190780 Y = 72454100 Seismic Lines: BP 83-308 SP 689 Drilling Rig: Nortrym (Semisubmersible) Water Depth: 340m RKB-Sealevel: Wellhead System: 25m Cameron, 18 3/4 10,000 psi, WS II Blowout Preventers: Cameron, 18 3/4 10,000 psiPROPOSED WELL PLAN OUTLINE  L NAME LOCATION N 65o 19' E 07o 15' DRILLING CONTRACTOR ESTIMATED WATER DEPTH 340 (1115') RIG KBM K/S NORTRYM A/S 25 (82') DEPTH DEPTH FT FORMATION TOPS TYPE DRILLING PROBLEMS TYPE OF FORMATION EVALUATION HOLE SIZE CASING FRACTURE GRADIENT FORM.

CRITICAL OPERATIONS AND CURTAILMENT PLAN A. General Coordination, Control and Curtailment Guidelines 1. All drilling operations will be done in compliance with appropriate Norwegian regulations. 2. Operations will be supervised onsite by Conoco representative. 3. Daily reports will be made to the Conoco Drilling Manager on the progress and status of drilling operations. 4. The Conoco Drilling Manager or his designated representative will be available by phone or radio on 24 hour/day, day/week basis. 5. The Conoco Drilling Manager will be provided with daily weather forecasts or more frecuent forecasts if severe weather is anticipated. B. Operational Limits Operations will be suspended if: 1. There are not sufficient materials onboard the rig to replace 60% of the active drilling fluid system with similar weight, rheoloaical, and fluid loss properties. 2. There is not enough barite onboard the rig to increase the weight of the gctive mud system by pound per gallon (.12 gm/cm ). 3. The vessel motion prohibits the prompt warning of a kick. 4. Any time that: a) Prompt communication with the standby boat is lost. b) The standby boat is more than ten minutes from the rig. 5. Tripping will cease when wind and vessel motion are such that the safety of the crew is in doubt.C. Critical Drilling Operations 1. Running and Cementing Casing a) The well will be circulated clean prior to running casing and the casing and running string will be kept full while running. Casing will be run to approximately - 10m off bottom and landed in the subsea hanger. Pit levels will be monitored for flow or lost circulation. b) safety valve to fit each casing connection will be on the rig floor while running casing. c) The BOP stack will not be pulled within 12 hours following cementing of casing. d) Casing operations will be suspended in the event of well flow until the well is controlled and in the event of conditions discussed in section of this plan. 2. Logging or Wireline Operations a) The well will be circulated clean before any logging operation. short trip and second circulation will be performed if abnormal pressures have been encountered. b) Because of the subsea stack, there will be no lubricator. Instead, member of the drill crew will monitor the well bore at all times for well flow or loss of fluid. C) Operations will be suspended in the event of well flow, severe loss of fluid, or conditions discussed in section of this plan. 3. Moving the Rig Off Location in an Emergency, Repositioning the Vessel on Location, and Re-entry into the Well. a) After positioning the rig and spudding, anchor lines will be marked to facilitate repositioning if movement is necessary. b) If conditions permit, the drill pipe will be hung-off, the rams locked, and an inside BOP left inside the drill pipe. c) The collet connector below the lower riser package will be opened, the riser picked up enough to clear the lower BOP package, and the guidelines slacked off.d) Downwind anchor lines will be slacked off and upwind anchor lines tightened to move the rig off location. e) To reposition the rig, this procedure is reversed. TV cameras and/or divers will be available for final positioning. f) Repositioning and/or re-entry operations will be suspended in the event of severe weather or recurrence of any emergency situation which necessitated withdrawal of the rig. 4. Evacuation Plan in the Event of an Emergency while Running 20 Casing with Riser Disconnected. a) Drop 20 casing to ocean floor. Use air tugger lines to help unlatch elevators. Be sure the casing slips are clear before releasing elevators. b) Slack off on downwind anchors. Pick up on upwind anchors. Pull rig safe distance from blowout. Rig may be pulled sideways if necessary. Under NO circumstances are the quarters to be pulled across the blowout or downwind to the blowout. Emergency brake releases for all anchor winches are located in the control room in the event that the winches are inaccessible. c) In the event that the 20 casing cannot be dropped, proceed to step regardless. The anchor lines and winches are strong enough to bend the casing. However, casing should be left in elevators without slips set. All personnel should stay clear of rig floor while attempting this operation. d) In the event all rig power is lost and the winches are inoperable, all personnel are to proceed to abandon the rig. Footnotes: 1. Alert standby boat of situation immediately. 2. Alert office of situation as soon as possible. 3. Safety meeting will be held to make all rig personnel familiar with the evacuation plan.5. Precautions if Reaming the Conductor Hole without a Riser. a) crew member will be watching the moon pool at all times. If gas flow occurs, the rig will be pulled off location as per section C.4 above. (Drill pipe would be dropped in step if possible). b) Mud will be spotted in the open hole before pulling the bit to run 20 casing. D. Circumstances or Conditions Reauiring Curtailment of Operations. All operations will be curtailed in the event of severe wind, and waves which disallow vessel stability. If needed supplies or personnel cannot be transported because of severe weather, the operations will also be suspended until these supplies or personnel can be transported. Likewise, the operations will be suspended if needed supplies or personnel are not on the wellsite for any reason.III III DRILLING PROGRAM A. Prespud Operations 1.

This program serves only as guide for the well. Hole conditions will dictate the rheological properties of the mud necessary to maintain hole stability and pressure control. To detect any change in mud weight while drilling, the mud will be checked at the flowline and at the suction pit every 30 minutes or more frequently if conditions warrant. The drilling fluid will be processed to make maximum use of the degasser for removing gas. The desander and desilter will be employed to maintain drill solids at minimum levels. The inventory of drilling fluid additives on board the rig will be sufficient to replace 60 % of the active drilling fluid system with drilling fluid having similar rheological properties. Also, there must be enough barite3on board to increase the weight of the fluid by gm/cm (1 pound per gallon).IV Interval: RKB - 465m; 36 hole This interval will be drilled with seawater while taking returns to the seabed. To facilitate hole cleaning, viscous sweeps of prehydrated gel will be used as needed. When the casing point has been reached and prior to pulling out of the hole, displace the entire hole with the viscous slurry. Rheological Properties: Weight; - ppg/1.14 - specific gravity Viscosity; 100 + Sec/qt Fluid loss; N.C. returns to the surface. Viscous sweeps of prehydrated gel will be used as needed to clean the hole. The section will be drilled initially with 17 1/2 bit, logged, and the hole opened to 26. When the 17 1/2 hole is drilled to casing setting depth, the hole will be displaced with the viscous slurry for logging. After the hole is opened to 26, the hole will be displaced with the viscous slurry for running casing. Weight; ppg/1.14 specific gravity. Viscosity; 100 + sec/qtThis interval will be drilled with GYP-polymer drilling fluid to provide an inhibitive environment for the highly reactive shales that occur.

The number of 12 1/4 rock bits given above takes this into account.IX. DIRECTIONAL SURVEY PROGRAM A. Surveys will be taken at least every 100m with the DMWD tool (Downhole Measurement while Drilling tool). A single shot survey will be taken on bit trips for verification of the DMWD surveys. Surveys using the rig's Totco survey instrument will be taken in 36 hole and 171/2 pilot hole. B. Multishot surveys shall be run at the 13 3/8 and 9 5/8 casing points. Gyro survey will be run in the 20 casing prior to drilling out.X X. PRESSURE CONTROL PROCEDURES The following are recommended to aid in prediction, detection, and/or control of abnormal pressure which may be encountered while drilling. 1. Continuously monitor and plot all drilling parameters obtained from the mudlogging unit to detect an increase or decrease in pore pressure.These parameters include, but are not limited to, mud weight in/out, mud temperature in/out, shale density, size/shape of cuttings, ROP, WOB, RPM, exponent, lithology, background gas, trip gas and connection gas. The exponent is to be kept current at all times to help detect any transition zones. 2. In addition to the drilling parameters that will be plotted by the mudlogging unit DMWD tool (Downhole Measurement While Drilling) will be used from the surface casing shoe to T.D.. The tool will plot formation resistivity, gamma ray, temperature, and take directional surveys. This too, will enhance the ability to detect transition zones. 3. Below the 30 casing, the driller is to observe the well at each connection until he is confident that the well is not flowing. 4. The driller is to observe the well for flow at each 1.5m/5ft drilling break or any other time he deems necessary. 5. The adjustable chokes are to be completely serviced prior to running the BOP stack and tested on weekly basis. 6. Flo-sho and pit level indicators are to be functioning properly at all times. This includes the alarm system, which will be set in 5-10 bbl position to allow prompt audio warning of an increase or reduction in flow. 7. Pit level drills shall be conducted tourly for each drilling crew. In addition, kick while tripping drill will be conducted each week. The drill crew will be instructed on the correct procedure for implementing the BOP in each drill. All drills will be recorded in the IADC report. 8. The Conoco representative shall develop suitable plan for the utilization of critical rig personnel during well kill operation.9. The Conoco representative shall evaluate drilling parameters and hole conditions to determine appropriate mud properties or other appropriate procedures. 10. Operations are not to be continued beyond the point where vessel motion prohibits prompt warning of kick.XI. TRIPPING PROGRAL 1. If abnormal pressures are encountered at casing or logging points, short trip and second circulation shall be performed. During trips out of the hole, the hole shall be filled from the trip tank and recorded as follows: a. b. C. Every five stands of drill pipe. Every three stands of Hevi-wate drill pipe. Every stand of drill collars. 3. If the hole does not take the calculated amount of fluid at any time during trip, inform the Conoco Drilling Supervisor immediately. Should this occur the following steps will be taken: a. Observe the well to determine if flowing. b. If not flowing, trip in the hole to bottom and circulate bottoms-up. c. If flowing, initiate Conoco's shut-in procedures for floating drilling vessels described in the well control section. 4. written record of hole fill up shall be maintained during each trip out of the hole. These reports shall be submitted to the Conoco Drilling Supervisor after each trip.XII XII. WELL CONTROL PROCEDURE The following well control work sheet serves as format for the information to be prerecorded and updated on daily basis. The sheet also contains the calculations to be performed in the event of kick. 1. The kill procedure uses the wait and weight method to circulate the kick and control the well. 2. Reduced circulating rates are to be taken each tour and recorded daily in the IADC report. These circulating pressures should be performed through the riser, not the choke and/or kill lines. The attached paper explains how choke line friction pressure losses contribute to bottom hole pressure and why the initial circulating pressure should be calculated using the reduced circulating pressure through the riser. 3. Conoco procedures regarding tripping, kick warnings, and shut in operations are also illustrated at the end of the well control section.LG tell Name: Rig ID 1 Pump Output alp No. Ilnip No. Pump No. Max.

The procedure for killing the well is more involved because the mud and gas must be pumped from the ocean floor through small ID choke Ae which acts as pcsitive choke in the w Values - Through riser or Choke e? There seems to be some confusion as to where the Plow value should be taken, through the hormal riser system or the choke line system? An example with brief discussion of the circulating system. may add clarity to the confusion. The Pla,v, value that is read on the standpiWe pressure gauge is the sum of the ?ressure losses in the system at that pum? rate, or: Plow = Ps + Pdp + Pdc + PB Where: Ps = Pressure loss through surface equipment P = Pressure loss through drill pipe pdp= Pressure loss through drill dc collars PB = Pressure loss through the bit PA = Pressure less in the annulus area Annular pressure loss, PA, is the only circulating pressure loss I?nposed on the formation. When killing well from floater, PA also includes the pressure loss throue the choke line system as the well must be killed using the choke line. PA in normal land well, or an offshore will where the BOP's are at rig level, is small and is ignored during the killing procedure. On wells where the BOPls are on the sea floor, the added pressure loss through the choke line becomes signifi- cant and must be taken into account to avoid breaking down the last casing shoe, resulting in an underground blowout. Because most of the wells drilled from floaters, especially by Conoco, are in the shallower water depths, (300-600 feet), the following discussion and example will depict those conditions instead of the 2000-3000 feet water depths. It should be remembered that very special prob- lems arise at the greater water depths, and these problems should be taken into account in the planning stages of the well in deeper water. They will be mentioned at the end of this discussion. An example problem will show the effects of the choke line pressure loss on equivalent hydrostatic pressure while circulating.

CLOSE CHOKE AS GAS ENTERS LINE FCP TO BIT STROKES OPEN CHOKE AS MUD Conversely, when the choke line begins to fill again with mud replacing the gas, the hydrostatic pressure will increase by the same amount over the time period calculated. As the gas enters the choke line and later the mud again enters the line, the ,r-Tac-D 3- 79ch. operator will be closing the choke and opening the choke rather rapidly attempting to maintain FCP. It should be remembered that as the hydrostatic pressure fluctuates as mentioned, so wil the constant drill pipe pressure decrease and again inc-ease if the choke is not alternately closed and opened. If the choke is not activated during this time secondary kick could occur. There are other complications that are puliar to the longer choke lines (water ohs). Some of these are listed below. 1 ICP may not be attainable at pecified SPM. Any time the in e choke line is greater than SIDPP, slower pump rate is needed so that choke line pressure loss is less than SIDPP.  Example: Assume Pt, (Riser) = 600 psi and Plow eoke Line) = 1000 psi This means that in the choke line If SIOPP = 300 psi, then ICI) would calculate to be 900 psi (600+300). This cannot happen because it takes 1000 psi it '- to circulate through the choke line hat stroke rate. lower stroke rate eeded. 2) FCP may not be attainable at .specified SPM even when ICP is attainable. In the previous example, if SIDPP was 500 psi then ICP would be 1100 psi (600+500). However, FCP would cal- culate to be: Assuming Original Density = 10 ppg - Kill Density= 11 ppg FCP 600 x.11 660 psi  which is also impossible when it takes 1000 psi to circulate the choke line with 10 ppg mud. Once again lower stroke rate is needed. 3) It may be necessary to establish P1 values with the cement pump in oder to effectively circulate out the kick. This will also give more reaction time when the gas displaces the mud in the choke line. If the individual is prepared and has Icnowledge of the basic rules of pressure control, the killing operation can go smoothly. Not anticipating the problem and over-reaction are large causes of problems that are encountered in pressure control.

Riser Margin: A good well plan should include provi- sions for emergencies if they should arise. One of these could be riser failure or an accidental loss of the riser. Iii this case there would be reduction in hydrostatic pressure equal to the differ- ence between the mud density and sea water density, or: HP = (MW - 8.5) where: MW = mud density, ppg 8.5 = sea water density, ppg L = length of riser in feet (ccno-,-.o) 5 3-79xa An, with mud density of ea ster density of ppg, and ength of 1000 feet, P = (10.5 - 8.5) 1000 P = 104 psi llow drilling, this could be as much 5 to ppg equivalent loss in m hole hydrostatic pressure. rgin needs to be added to the mud ty Akcompensate for this effect. man can be calculated by: (MW D) - (L 8.5) mw m D-L Rm = Riser margin, ppg D = Total TVD, kelly bushing, feet L = Riser length, feet MW = Mud density, ppg It should be noted that riser margin and trip margin should not be added together but the value used should be the greater of the two.k1LWUkJ L.17 Olt 'ote: Do not allow mud in annulus to drop more than 100 ft; therefore aximum number stands drill PIPE to be pulled before filling hole: to fill hole for ______________ size drill pipe.  fill hole for _____________ size drill pipe. la irm number stands drill COLLARS to be pulled before filling hole: to fill hole for _____________ size drill collars. to fill hole for _____________size drill collars.

The blowout preventer stack, choke and kill lines, choke manifold, kelly cocks, and drill pipe safety valves should be pressure tested at least once week during drilling operations. B. Control pods should be alternated for tests. C. Prior to running the BOP stack, the stack should be stump tested to full working pressure. The pipe rams should be tested to 10,000 psi and the annular preventers to 3500 psi. D. On the seafloor, the BOP stack will be tested to low pressure test of 500 psi and high pressure test equivalent to the maximum anticipated surface pressure for the casing string cemented in place. 1.

These results should be compared with the normal opening/closing times and volumes required of the hydraulic system. Any major differences are an indication that the system is not operating normally and may require further investigation or repairs. 9. For all pressure tests either the Drilling Supervisor or Drilling Engineer must be present.E.

During leak-off test, do not exceed 85% of the burst pressure of casing, wellhead equipment, BOP's, or surface equipment. B. Leak-off Test 1. Drill to within 10' of the casing shoe and circulate the hole clean. Close BOP's and pump at rate of 1/4 to 1/2 BPM with the cementing unit. Continue pumping until the anticipated leak-off pressure + 200 psi has been reached. Hold pressure 10 minutes to insure there are no leaks. Record the volume of fluid pumped. 2. Drill remaining cement and 3m/lOft of new formation, circulate and condition hole, and pull bit inside casing. 3. Rig up cementing unit and insure pressure gauges are operating correctly. 4. After closing BOP's, pump at rate of 1/4 to 1/2 BPM and maintain constant pump rate. 5. Plot pressure versus mud volume on graph and establish straight line slope. Continue pumping until graphed point deviates from straight line, shut down pump and release pressure. 6. Record pressure from point of deviation on graph. Use this pressure, mud weight, and casing depth to calculate the leak-off pressure in pound per gallon equivalent. 7. If the leak-off test result is unsatisfactory, condition mud and perform second test. Contact the Drilling Manager with the results of both tests.At that time, decision on whether to squeeze the shoe will be made. 8. If the new formation should have insufficient formation strength to reach the next proposed casing setting depth, new setting depth will be determined.9. The following is list of the kick tolerances at each casing shoe when the next casing point has been reached. Kick tolerance at 20 casing shoe is 0.51 ppg. Kick tolerance at 13 3/8 casing shoe is 3.90 ppg. The above listed factors were calculated with the predicted mud weight, fracture gradient, and casing setting depths.Casing Shoe Test Itleneral Data: Well Casing Size Type Test: Bradenhead Date Shoe Depth T.D. , LS Fractured ' Unfractured ; ' Type .

Hang-off Procedure Note: Have hang-off string with the hang-off tool made up and standing back in the derrick. The hang-off string should be strapped and marked with each stand numbered for easy reference. The following procedures are with the use of a permanent hang-off assembly. The hang-off point when drilling inside the 20 casing is the seat protector. The 13 3/8 or 5/8 casing is the wear bushing. The mud density should be high enough above the formation pressure to account for riser loss. 1. Pick up the drill string and pull enough stands so that when the drill string is hung-off the bit should preferably be inside the casing or at least five stands off bottom. 2. Pick up the hang-off tool which is made up on the bottom of the stand and make it up in the drill string. 3. Lower the hang-off mandrel through the rotary table and set it in the slips. 4. Break the tool joint of the hang-off running sub and make it back up using chain tongs only. This sub has pitch modified square left hand running thread. To break, rotate to the right. To make-up, rotate to the left. 5. With the hang-off string, run the hang-off tool to the BOP stack using the drill string compensator. 6. Land the tool in the seat protector or wear bushing. 7. Close the middle pipe rams (Rams No.3) 8. Close the lower pipe rams (Rams No.4).9. Lock the wedge locks. Test the wedge locks by attempting to open the lower pipe rams (Rams No. 4). The back flow should be no more than gallons if the wedge locks are locked. 10. Back off the running string from the hang-off tool and retrieve the running string to the rig floor. Note: Back-off by rotating to the right. 11. Close the blind/shear rams. B. Retrieving the Hang-off Tool Remove the running sub from the retrieving tool. Before retrieving the hang-off tool, the choke and kill valves will be opened so that any pressure build up that may have accumulated during the hang-off period is bled off to the choke manifold. 1. With the hang-off string, run in the hole to the top of the BOP stack using bumper subs and the drill string compensator. 2. Very gently tag the blind/shear rams with the retrieving string and pick up 4-8 inches. With the annular regulator pressure set at 450 psi to 500 psi, close the upper annular BOP to centralize the retrieving string in the stack bore. 3. Unlock the wedge locks and open the blind/shear rams. 4. Lower the retrieving string into the hang-off tool and make it up with drill pipe tongs. 5. Open the lower pipe rams (Rams No. 4) and the upper annular BOP. 6. Pick up about feet on the retrieving string to indicate weight and open the middle pipe rams (Rams No. 3). 7. Continue to pick up slowly, watching the weight indicator for evidence of stuck pipe. 8. Retrieve the hang-off tool taking special care to prevent rotation of the string until the tool is in the slips.XVI XVI.

By Norwegian Petroleum Directorate; Section 4.11.XVII XVII. INSTRUCTIONS TO STANDBY VESSELS These instructions are issued to advise Masters of the duties and responsibilities of standby vessels attending offshore installations. They are not intended in any way to cancel or overrule any instructions issued by Government or superior authority nor are they to be interpreted as being in any way contrary to the ordinary practice of seamen. A. Purpose of Standby Vessel A standby vessel is to be in constant attendance at the offshore drilling rig for the purpose of: 1. Rescue of man overboard. 2. Evacuation of rig personnel and emergency assistance. 3. Surveillance. 4. Security. 5. Morale of offshore employees. B. Taking Up Station When en route to take up station, the Master is to establish radio contact and advise the drilling rig of his ETA. On arrival he must report the operational state of his vessel, its radio, navigation and lifesaving equipment, and must subsequently report any changes which may occur. The vessel must obtain information from the drilling rig concerning: 1. Navigational lights and signals shown. 2. Emergency signals. 3. Pattern of anchor buoys. 4. Any special operations taking place. The vessel is to maintain station up to one nautical mile from the installation and is to remain in tie-up position unless authorizedotherwise, with full engine power and maneuverability available at all times. C. Evacuation of the Drilling Rig This is the major disaster situation with which the vessel is required to deal. All other operations carried out by the vessel should be carried out with this task in mind. Since no specific situation can be defined, it is considered that the overriding factor must be to ensure the survival of the maximum number of persons and is the Master's main responsibility. In such an emergency situation he must assume responsibility for all operations external to the drilling rig unless specifically instructed to the contrary. Masters should bear in mind that in addition to oil on the water there may be inflammable gas drifting on the wind on the lee side of the drilling rig. The equipment for the reception of survivors must be maintained in first class condition and ready for immediate use at all times. The crew must be well trained in its use. D. Surveillance The Master and officials should: 1. Twice daily at sunrise and sunset check the situation of all buoys in the vicinity of the drilling rig and report to the drilling rig. Should any buoy be found to be adrift, it must be reported immediately. 2. Note the position of evacuation points on the drilling rig, e.g., lifeboats, life rafts, scrambling nets and cranes. 3. Note the malfunction of any light or sound signals on the drilling rig and report them immediately. 4. Note any pollution or breaches of the rules regarding dumping at sea and report them E. Emergency Assistance 1. Man Overboard It must be remembered that there is always possibility of man falling overboard from an offshore installation. Should this happen, the drilling rig will advise the vessel of the area from which the man has fallen and will,when possible, direct the vessel towards the man. In many cases, the man will be in position which will prevent the standby vessel closing with him (for example, within the framework of an open structure or semi submersible). In such cases the rig lifeboat would be used to effect the rescue. 2. Helicopter Operations When advised by the rig that helicopter operations are to take place, the crew are to be alerted, all lifesaving equipment to be brought to an immediate state of readiness. The Master must position the vessel so that he is in the best position to effect rescue should an accident occur, but must not place the vessel in the flight path of the helicopter. Note: 3. Fire Helicopters usually approach into wind. The standby vessel should therefore position himself to leeward of the platform and just to one side of the anticipated flight path. If bad weather or conditions warrant. In the event of fire on board the drilling rig, the vessel must prepare all its firefighting and lifesaving equipment and close the rig. If possible, the Master of the vessel should establish the nature of the fire before taking any emergency action. 4. Diving Operations When advised by the rig that diving operations are to take place, the vessel shall close the rig and take up position as directed by the drilling foreman. If it is necessary to move away from the diving operations area, authority to do so must be obtained from the rig. F. Security The standby vessel must report to the rig the identity of any vessels which approach the rig or whose maneuvers in the vicinity appear suspicious. Attempts should be made to prevent unauthorized vessels from entering the buoy pattern or approaching the rig to distance of less than 500 meters. Should any unauthorized vessel so approach, the standby vessel must inform the rig and record the maneuvers of the approaching vessel in the log book.G. Communications The normal method will be on low band company radio on the usual working channel used by the rig. Any change in channel will be advised by the designated VHF channel and company low band radio. loud hailer is to be immediately available on the bridge for voice communication. The drilling foreman must be advised of any difficulties experienced in communication; in particular he must be advised of any fault concerning radio equipment. H. Ship's Log This is to be kept in the English language and is to be complete record of events on board the standby vessel and of those observed on board the I. Exercises: Daily 1. The vessel must encircle the rig at full speed. 2. Searchlights and floodlights must be operated. 3. The crew must be drilled at emergency stations. J. Exercises: Periodic At least once in each fourteen-day period, the following exercises are to be conducted: 1. Man overboard drill (on instruction from the rig). 2. Radar to be utilized to simulate poor visibility conditions. The drilling foreman must be advised before any drill is carried out and the fact noted in the vessel's log book. K. Promulgation A copy of these instructions must be issued to: 1. The standby vessel's Master. 2. The vessel's owners. 3. The vessel's charters. 4. Drilling foreman.ATTACH= NO.

NEAREST WELL CONTROL: (Distance: direction from 6507/7-4) 6507/7-2: 6507/7-3: 3.0km NE 1.6km 2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING Block 6507/7 lies in the northern part of the Haltenbanken designated area, approximately 190km west of the Norwegian coast. It lies on the western flank of a series of NNE-SSW faults which separate the deep VOring Basin from the TrOndelag Platform to the east. The prospect is located along the western margin of the NNE-SSW oriented fault trend. The prospect is southwards plunging horst block formed by Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous tensional faulting. Closure is provided by convergence of the two major bounding faults with spill across to the north. The structure is heavily eroded at the crest where Upper Cretaceous sediments rest unconformably on Jurassic sediments. The main reservoir objective is the Middle Jurassic Sandstone, which pinches out onto the structure. SAG7/6-l'IDAM'3.

LOGGING PROGRAM All logs should be recorded on digital tape. See NPD requirement in Appendix 2.5. A MWD tool will be run from below the 20 casing shoe to TD to provide gamma ray and shallow resistivity correlations as well as inclination and azimuth. 5.2. WIRELINE LOGGING Log Run No. 1: (at approx. 1025m KB in 171/2 pilot hole) ISF-LSS-MSFL-GR GR to seafloor for sensitivity adjustment. Log Run No. 2: (at approx. 2390m KB in 171/2 hole) LDL-CNL-GR-CST (DLL, NGL, RFT if shows encountered)Log Run No. 3: (at approx. 2840m KB in 12 1/4 hole) LDL-CNL-NGT (FDC/CNL/GR, optional) DLL-MSFL-GR SHDT CST RFT NOTE: Additional sidewall coring may be carried out at the discretion of the wellsite geologist. Logging program may be subject to alteration dependent on the results of the well. 6. SAMPLING 6.1. BIT CUTTINGS See Appendix 2.1.-2.5. and 3.1. for instructions concerning distribution to partners, government departments, consultants and storage warehouses. Samples of bit cuttings will be caught at 10m intervals from the 30 shoe to 1850m KB. Below 1850m KB samples of bit cuttings will be taken at 3m intervals. Additional assistance in catching the samples may be required during the fast drilling in the upper part of the section. Provision should be made for mudlogging personnel to be available to handle this before the well spuds. Sampling interval may be reduced in any part of the section, at the discretion of the wellsite geologist. Plastic bags should be clearly marked for depth, using waterproof ink or dye. They should be drip dried, under cover, packed in sequence in wooden boxes and shipped ashore at the earliest opportunity. 6.2. CORING It is planned to core a) any Middle Jurassic hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs that are encountered and b) the equivalent thickness of Lower Jurassic sandstones that were penetrated in the 6507/7-2 discovery well. Conventional coring in the 6507/7-2 well was not successful in recovering the friable and better quality sands in zone of the pay interval. Therefore, the exploration department plans to utilize a conventional core barrel with fiber glass inner barrel in this well. In the event that any other hydrocarbon reservoirs are encountered coring will be considered. The top of the cored intervals will be picked by drilling breaks and circulated samples. The following procedure should be observed under the supervision of the Conoco wellsite geologist:- Once drilling break is encountered stop drilling, check for flow, if negative, circulate and notify the Conoco geologist (preferably less than 2, but no more than 3m of formation should be penetrated during the break). - Circulate up sample and have the Conoco geologist determine if core is to be cut. - Handling procedures are detailed in Appendix 3.3. 6.3. DRILL STEM TESTING In the event of cased hole drill stem tests or FIT's being necessary, standard procedures for collecting data will be followed under supervision of representative of the Production Department. If cased hole drill stem testing is performed, detailed program will be submitted to the partners and the NPD for approval. 6.4. FLUID SAMPLING Should drill-stem testing be carried out, fluid sample requirements will be specified in the test program. RFT fluid sampling will be at the discrection of the wellsite geologist. The sample distribution list is enclosed in Appendices 2.1.-2.5. On completion of the well the Mudlogging Party Chief must hand over to the wellsite geologist all mudlogging data, and any confidential material which has been loaned to him for reference purposes. - All shipments to shore of samples and cores should be clearly labelled as to contents. On arrival, they will be shipped to final destination. - The Conoco Drilling Supervisor should see that the pipe is strapped prior to logging, coring or running the DST's in order to ensure accurate depth control. - Since this well is being drilled from floating rig in an area of possible abnormal pressure, full pressure control instrumentation and engineering will be required (see sec. H). - All wireline logs, mud logs and lithology logs must be recorded with depths in metric units.Age/Fm. Recent Pliocene Hordaland Gp. Balder Fn.
