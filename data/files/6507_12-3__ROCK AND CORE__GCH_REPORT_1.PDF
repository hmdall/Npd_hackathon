SUMMARY Cuttings samples from the sequence 1000 in - 2600 (TD) of Saga Petroleum NOCS 6507/12-3 Haltenbanken well were subjected to routine geochemical screening analyses. Sklinna Group claystones have moderate to high TOC contents decreasing with depth. Skomvmr to Halten Group claystones have fair to average TOC contents whilst sandstones in the Halten Group have poor TOC contents. Flatten Group coals/carbonaceous claystones have high TOC contents (up to 32 %).GEOLABENOR ,EocleACAL LABOOPIONES OF NORWAY A/S -3- 2. INTRODUCTION Routine geochemical screening analyses of samples from Halten- banken well 6507/12-3 were commissioned by Ellen Sofie Mo on behalf of Saga Petroleum 1k/S. Canned samples from 390 to 2600 in (TD) were received at GEOLAB NOR. The programme for screening analyses was as follows: a. From 1000 RKB throughout the Tertiary: every 3rd sample (30). b. From top Cretaceous (1863 m) to TD: every 2nd sample (40).GEOLA131INOR -4 The following Formation tops were supplied: SULA GP SEABED SKLINNA GP 1311 MRKB SKOMVER GP 1775 FLATOY GP 1862 GRIP GP 1937 HALTEN GP TOMMA FM 1972 LEKA FM 2098 ALDRA FM 2186 HITRA FM 2351 T.D. 2600 CASING POINTS: 375 MRKB Analyses requested were: Headspace gas (C1-C7) Occluded gas (C1-C7) Washing Lithological description Handpicking (where necessary) Total Organic Carbon.GEOLABIONOR GEICHEMICkt 0/40441SYME 1424SSAY 4/S -5- The contract required for one draft copy of this report to be forwarded to Saga Petroleum for approval.

SAMPLE QUALITY Throughout the drilled sequence the cans were in good condition (no evidence of faulty seals or leaks). However, in the interval 0 the samples were very soft and difficult to clean. Very little material was present in some samples after removal of drilling muds. The size fraction constituting the bulk of any sample varies greatly. Where possible mm fractions are picked for analysis. However, in some samples there was insufficient material in the mm and in the 125 mm fractions for analysis. The mm fraction is not used for analysis so in these samples no TOC analyses were performed. Around the casing point at 1949 (especially at about 1950 - 2050 m) the samples contain almost exclusively cement. No significant fluorescence was observed from any samples following screening examination in UV light.GEOIABENOR . GEOCNEMiCAL LABORATORIES OF NORWAY A'S -7- 4. RESULTS A. LIGHT HYDROCARBONS (Table 2, Fig 1). From 1000 to 1540 the samples are generally rich in total C1-C4 gas whereas C5+ abundances are extremely low. Of the C1-C4 compounds the vast majority of the material is methane (hence low wetness values of generally less than %). iC4/nC4 ratios are variable due to low abundances. From 1570 to 2400 C1-C4 abundances are generally poor to fair, although fair to good from 1570 to 1830 and good to rich from 2130 - 2148 m. Towards the base of this section (2202 - 2346 m) Cl-C4 abundances are very poor. Throughout the whole of this section C5+ abundances are poor. In the zones of fair to good total C1-C4 abundances the gas comprises very dominantly methane (hence wetness values similar to the interval above). At the base of the section where total abundances are low, wetness values increase to the 10-30 % level though this is probably unreliable due to the very low amounts. Lower values from 1977-2040 are most probably related to the poor sample qualities, very little true lithology present, mostly cement contamination. From 2400 to TD there is distinct jump in the C - 1 C4 gas abundances to rich levels (as high as 58880GEOLAB 111 NOR GEocHE,,vrk LIOWNIES Of NORWAY 40 -8- pa gas/kg rock at 2600 m). Wetness values are similar to above (10-30 %). The increase in C1-C4 gas abundances probably reflects the increased gas production and retention in the carbonaceous claystones and coals in the base sections. Further characterisation of kerogen type would perhaps suggest whether or not this is plausible. iC4 /nC4 ratios are 2-5 throughout this section. There is increase in C5+ abundances in of the samples but this is to only fair abundances. The distribution of C1-C4 hydrocarbons as seen in this well probably represents biogenic methane in the upper section whilst low abundances may be attributed to either (i) low gas production or (ii) loss of gas due to release in pressure and easy escape from very permeable, poorly consolidated lithologies. Higher amounts at the base are probably directly attributable to generation from the organic rich claystone and coal sequence, though the likelihood of this can not be confirmed without further analyses to characterise kerogen composition. B. LITHOLOGY (Table Fig 1). The whole of the Sula Group and the upper part of the Sklinna Group (down to 1420 m) consists of mixed unconsolidated quartz sand (clean, subrounded) together with igneous fragments and cement in varying proportions. In the 1450 sample there is sudden break with theGEOIABINOR OEOCHEMICAL LABORATORIES OF NORWAY ARS -9- appearance of silty brown grey to olive grey claystone. This claystone dominates throughout the Sklinna Group and together with varying amounts of red-brown claystone and light to medium grey claystone (which may be distinct beds or gradational changes) it comprises all of the samples throughout the Skomvmr Group and Flatoy Group. At 1977 (Grip Group) the effect of the 1949 casing point is clearly seen - most of the samples to 2022 contain significant amounts of cement. The lithology of the Grip Group is therefore difficult to ascertain. Below this, despite some continued evidence of contamination, the top of the Halten Group is dominated by sandstone. At 2148 there is reappearance of medium dark grey claystone. Due to the vertical distance between this and similar claystone above, together with the fact that the upper section of the hole is cased, it is assumed in the absence of logs that this claystone is in-situ and represents part of sand-claystone interbedded sequence. At 2328 in the first traces of coal are seen. This varies but generally increases through the rest of the Halten Group. The coal appears to be of varying quality/purity and would perhaps be better classified as carbonaceous claystone or carbargillite. The purity, classification and potential of this organic rich sequence probably merits more detailed examination.UOVEMICALIABORMORIES Of NORWAY WS -10- C. TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON Sula Group Samples from this Group contained clean, loose sand grains and igneous fragments. Consequently no samples were analysed for TOC content. Sklinna Group (Top= 1311 RKB) Initially in this Group, as above, the lithologies are loose sand grains plus igneous fragments. However, from approximately 1450 claystones are encountered and 12 samples from this Group were analysed for TOC content. The first sample analysed is the sandstone at 1420 m. This has TOC of only % and provides reference for the sandstone and against which the claystone can be compared. The first claystone encountered (silty, brown grey to olive grey at 1450 m) has high TOC of %. This is followed by two samples of similar lithology at 1480m and 1510 with good-rich TOC contents of % and 2.39 % respectively. The sample at 1540 although seen to be very similar claystone has reduced value of % and may represent transition zone in terms of organic production and/or preservation. This is confirmed by the next two samples - 1570 contains greener claystone with further reduction in TOC content to % whilst 1600 with TOC of % is described as slightly browner in nature. Thus, albeit on limited grounds due to only having TOC data it is possible that the zone 1540 -GEOLA131 NOR GEOGHEMICAL LABORATORIES OF NORWAY WS -11- 1600 represents transitional zone in terms of environment and/or preservation capabilities. This becomes more plausible in view of the 1630 in sample which contains green - olive green claystone with fair TOC of %. The rest of this Group has samples analysed and the TOC values range 0.44-0.69 % (all from green/olive grey claystone). Skomvmr Group (Top= 1775m RKB) Four samples within this Group were analysed for TOC content. This group contains green-grey claystones as found above but interbedded with varying amounts of medium to dark red brown claystone. The green grey claystones have poor to fair TOC contents ranging from claystone, as might be expected, contains poor quantities of organic matter (two values at 1780 in and 1810 in both record %). One sample of medium grey claystone at 1830 in contains % TOC, slight improvement for this Group. Flatov Group (Top= 1862 RKB) This Group continues with light grey/green grey claystones with TOC values ranging from % (1930 m) to % (1910 m). medium grey claystone at 1930 contains slightly elevated TOC content of %. This is the base sample analysed in the Group.GEOCHEMICAL LABORATORIES OF NORWAY A'S -12- Grip Group (Top= 1937 RKB) One sample of green to olive grey claystone at 1950 was analysed for TOC content and this continues the slight increase in TOC as seen in the base sample of the Flatoy Group with TOC of 0.85%. Halten Group (Top Tomma Fm= 1972 RKB) Within the Tomma Fm. of the Halten Group only two of the samples were analysed for TOC content (1977 - TOC =0.95% and 1986 - TOC =0.99 %, both light, medium to dark grey claystones). Below this the samples appear to consist almost exclusively of loose sand grains and/or cement/contamination (casing point at 1949 m). The same is true of the first part of the Leka Fm. (Top= 2098 m), where the samples have very little recovered material in the mm size range, or consist of contamination. One sample from this formation, consisting of claystone, sandstone and contaminants (2166 m) was analysed bulk in order to have enough material. The measured TOC content of % is similar to those found in the Tommma Fm. and is probably representative. Six samples from the Aldra Fm. (Top= 2186 m) were analysed. The lithology analysed, where present in sufficient amounts, is medium-green grey claystone and values range from % (2256 m) to % (2274 m). The sandstone also present in these samples was analysed atGEOLABINOR GROCHRMICAL LABORATORIES OF NORWAY EJS -13- This probably serves to highlight that within the sandstone the TOC content is very dependent on the chance presence of carbonaceous fragments. In the Hitra Fm. (Top= 2351 m) the samples contain variable mixtures of sandstone and carbonaceous claystone or coal. Four sandstone samples were analysed and values, as above, range from % at 2382 to % at 2364 m. The samples grading from carbonaceous claystone (carbargillite?) to coal have correspondingly variable TOC contents from % at 2454 to % at 2490 m.GEOLMINOR UNWLAOWMOUNOMMWS -14- 5. CONCLUSIONS Sample quality and quantity varies throughout the well. Quality is particularly poor below the 1949 casing point. Some brown grey claystones in the Sklinna Group have rich TOC contents (up to %) and the coals/carbonaceous claystones of the Halten Group have TOC contents up to 32 %. The remainder of the claystones (green grey) have variable TOC's but are below %, Sandstone samples analysed as reference have characteristically low TOC's ( %). Light hydrocarbon gas abundances are generally highest from 2400 - 2600 (dominantly methane and ethane). This is probably directly related to the carbonacous claystone and coals.6E01111311NOR GEOCHEMICAL LABORATORIES OF NORWAY NG -15- 6. RECOMMENDATIONS The results presented in this report represent very elementary screening programme upon which, follow-up analyses will be decided. It is recommended that follow-up analyses are performed on certain sections of interest to characterise the source potential (especially of the coal sequence which within the Haltenbanken area may prove to be potentially good source rock and within this well is characterised by higher light hydrocarbon abundances). Follow-up analyses should include Rock-Eval pyrolysis, visual kerogen, maturity assessments (vitrinite reflectance) and extraction gas chromatography where appropriate. Analysis of the coals by hydrous pyrolysis might, in conjunction with maturity considerations and visual kerogen descriptions, give information on their hydrocarbon potential.GEOLABPANOR GENKWALLAMWORIESUWMMNS TABLE CONCENTRATION OF Cl - 07 HYDROCARBONS IN HEADSPACE.
