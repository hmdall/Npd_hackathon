GLOSSARY OF TERMSPEB/15/89 SUMMARY This report presents the results of pVT study conducted on reservoir fluid from Ula wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7. Both wells were sampled using downhole formation testers. Originally four sample chambers were sent to RCS, but oil obtained from well 7/12A-12 and another sample from well 7/12-7 were found to have low saturation pressures (below 400 psia at 260 F). These fluids were therefore not considered suitable for any pVT studies. The reservoir fluid from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 have saturation pressures at 260 F of 1941 and 1 687 psia with densities under the same conditions of and kg/m3 respectively. A single flash separation was carried out on both samples. The GOR of the fluid from well 7/12A-01 was measured at 250 scf/stb, with value of 290 scf/stb being recorded for that of well 7/12-7.

INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Four reservoir fluid samples were taken from the Ula field using downhole formation testers and the sample charrbers sent to the Research Centre Sunbury (RCS). These fluids were transferred single phase into storage vessels with the oil/water ratios being monitored (Table 5.1). Samples of the stabilised oil and brine recovered were supplied to the Geochemistry Branch at RCS for additional analysis. The results of this work are the subject of another report [1]. 7/12A-01 A Dresser Formation Multiple Tester (FMT) was used to sample this well and the chamber transported to RCS. Approximately I. of pressurised oil was recovered together with further 260 cc of an oily emulsion like material. This emulsion was flashed to atmospheric conditions anc allowed to stand for several days. Water was detected, but proved very difficult to separate out from the emulsion. 7/12-7 Two separate samples were taken from this well using Schlumberger Repeat Formation Testers (RFT). RFT, sample number 5B was found to contain no formation brine but I. of pressurised oil was recovered. The other IRFT (sample no. 6C) produced only 300 cc of stabilised crude together with over I. of brine. MARCH, 1989 SECTION - PAGEPEB/15/89 INTRODUCTION 7/12A-12 A Dresser FMT was used to obtain the reservoir fluid sample. On inspection at RCS, this sampler was found to hold only 360 cc of very light clear oil. further I. of formation brine was recovered and flashed from the FMT. It is important to remember that as result of mud filtrate contamination, samples taken using formation testers are rarely representative of the reservoir fluid. However, they are useful to provide a first indication of the nature of the fluid and its composition. The downhole oil samples recovered were validated in the laboratory by measuring their saturation pressures (Table 5.2). Only stabilised crude was recovered from well 7/12-7 (sample no. 6C), while the 7/12A-12 oil was found to have saturation pressure of 361 psia at 75F. After discussion with BP Pet. Dev. Norway it was decided to continue the study on the remaining samples from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 (sample no. 5B). A single flash experiment was conducted on each of the valid samples and the reservoir fluid composition determined. Single phase density measurements were also made on these fluids at temperature of 260F.PEB/15/89 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This section contains discussion concerning the results of the study. Table and figure numbers are prefixed by the section number in which they are to be found. The sample transfer and validation procedures adopted for these formation testers are included in Section 7.1. The oil/water ratios monitored during the transfer are shown in Table 5.1. The reservoir oil was transferred single phase into pressure vessels in order to allow further pVT work to be carried out. The results of these studies are contained in this report. Any brines recovered from the downhole sample chambers were flashed to atmospheric conditions for additional analyses by Geochemistry Branch at RCS. The RFT sample (No.6C) from 7/12-7 was found to contain only stabilised oil and formation brine. This oil was not used for any of the pVT studies. The results cf the validation of the three remaining downhole reservoir oil samples are presented in Table 5.2. Only the downhole samples taken from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 (sample no. 5B) were considered to be worthy of further investigation. The FMT sampler, from well 7/12A-12, produced clear oily fluid with saturation pressure of 361 psia at 75 F. Single flash separations at 68 F were carried out on two reservoir fluid samples. The experimental procedure for this test is described in Section 7.2.FEB/15/89 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A summary of the flash separations of the fluids from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 are given in tables 5.3 and respectively. The results of the analyses of the flashed gas and stabilised oil, together with mathematically recombined analysis (to the respective volumetric GOR's) of the reservoir fluid are presented in Tables and 5.9. The average molecular weight of the C20+ fraction was calculated from the simulated True Boiling Point (TBP) data (Tables and 5.10), obtained by gas- liquid chromatography (GLC). These values were used to convert the analyses from mass to molar basis. The estimation of the uncertainties in the reservoir fluid analyses have been included as Tables and 7.3. It should be noted that, except for benzene and toluene, the C5+ components quoted in the analyses are not pure components. For example, the (C9+ - C10) fraction contains all hydrocarbons whose boiling points are greater than n-C9H20 and less than or equal to the boiling point of n-C10H22. The average molecular weight of the (C9+ - C10) is taken to be that of n-Ci0H22, i.e. g/mol. The analysis of the reservoir oil from 7/12A-01 shows relatively low percentage of the C20+ fraction (15.2 wt%). This is not common for black oil system where this fraction is normally in the order of 30 to 40 wt%. This analysis is also characterised by abnormally large component fractions between 012 and 018, suggesting contamination of the sample. The analysis of the 7/12-7 fluid is more typical of black oil with C20+ fraction of wt% and more evenly distributed component fractions above 05. Both these samples have similar compositional analyses up to C9, which are comparable with previously reported data from wells 7/12-2 [2] and 7/12-4 [3]. There are some variations, with both the samples from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 having slightly lower component fractions than the earlier analyses. The average percentage of the C9+ fraction for the previously reported data is 66 wt%, compared to wt% for well 7/12-7 and wt% for 7/12A-01. In addition, the gas/oil ratios obtained from these two wells is below half of that quoted for wells 7/12-2 and 7/12-4. For the 09 fraction only the analysis from well 7/12-4 is available for comparison, with the compositional variations following the trend of the fluid sample from 7/12-7. The 020+ fraction for the 7/12-4 sample was reported as wt%.This difference in the fluid compositions between the samples from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 can not easily be explained. However due to the method of the sampling (i.e. downhole formation testers), ccntamination of the 7/12A-01 sample is probable. Variations between the 7/12-7 sample and previously quoted analyses is slight, but care should be taken in inlerpretation this data as sample contamination is also possibility. The experimental method of determining densities and volumes is given in Section 7.3. Tne estimation of the uncertainties in the physical properties are given in Table Oil compressibilities were measured using the method outlined in Section 9. Experimental results of the single phase densities and volumetric properties of the reservoir fluid samples from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 at 260 F are given in Tables and 8.2. These results are presented graphically in Figures and 8.2. Interpolated values obtained from this data are presented in Table and Figure for well 7/12A- 01. Similar results for 7/12-7 are given in Table and Figure 6.3. The reservoir fluids have saturation pressures at 260 F of 1941 and 1687 psia respectively, with densities at these conditions of and kg/m3. Oil compressibilities at the temperature of 260 F are similar for both fluids and are shown in Tables 5.7, and 5.12. They are presented graphically in Figures and 6.4. Even allowing for temperature changes (previous results have been reported at 295 F) the saturation pressures for these two fluids are lower than that expected from the Ula field (approximately 2500 at 295 F). The densities are also considerably lower than previously reported values, which are typically of the order of 635 kg/m3. The variations from previous studies suggest that both the downhole samples from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 have been contaminated and are not typical of the Ula field. MARCH 1989 SECTION - PAGEPEB/15/89 CONCLUSIONS Of the four samples taken from the Ula field using downhole formation testers, it was only possible to carry out any pVT work on reservoir oil from wells 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 (sample no. 5B). This is not surprising due to the nature of the testing procedure, which is both difficult and prone to contamination from mud filtrate. At temperature of 260 F the fluid from 7/12A-01 has saturation pressure of 1941 psia with density under the same conditions of kg/m3. The reservoir oil recovered from 7/12-7 was found to have saturation pressure of 1687 psia at 260 F with corresponding density of kg/m3. The compressibility values obtained in the single phase region, were similar for both samples. These values of saturation pressure and density are lower than those previously reported for the Ula field, which could be due to contamination of both samples. Although both oils were flashed to atmospheric conditions and the evolved fluids analysed, it is impossible to make any direct comparison between the two wells. When mathematically recombined the composition of the reservoir oil from 7/12-7 follows the typical from of black oil. However the sample from 7/12A-01 has low percentage of the C20+ fraction in its analysis, together with higher than expected quantities of C12 to C18 components. When compared with previously reported fluid analysis from the Ula field, both samples show some variations. This supports the supposition that both samples have been contaminated and as such should not be considered representative of the Ula field.a iFEB/15/89 REFERENCES 1. WHITE, R.L. 2.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND UNCERTAINTIES Complete details of the experimental pVT procedures are described in Sunbury report 'An Introductory Course in PVT' [4]. This section summarises the experimental procedures carried out during this reservoir oil study and the repeatabilities of the generated results. strict definition of the repeatability of result is: The difference between successive test results obtained by the same operator with the E ame apparatus under constant operating conditions would, in the long run, exceed this value in only one case in twenty (95%). The repeatabilities of the basic measurements of mass, pressure, volume and temperature made during an experiment were estimated and used to calculate the repeatabilities given in this section. 7.1 Sample Transfer and Validation Both the RFT and EMT samplers are of similar design with piston incorporated into the sample chamber. The downhcle samplers were first checked for obvious signs of leakage. quick 'PV' was carried out in the downhole sample chamber vessel, prior to the fluid being transferred, in order to check that gas has not peen lost in transport or that it was an invalid sample for other reasons. A high pressure displacement pump was connected to the water side of the sample chamber. The. sampler was periodically agitated as water was injected, the pressure being recorded at each stage When the pressure in the sample chamber did not drop after agitation the reservoir fluid wa5. assumed to be single phase. Additional water was injected until the pressure within the chamber was increa&Hlto approximately 1000 psi above the bubble point. The sampler was then left to stand vertically for several hours in order to allow segregation of the oil and formation brine. MARCH, 1989 SECTION - PAGE -1The reservoir fluid sample was transferred single phase into suitable storage vessels using calibrated displacement pump. By flowing through high pressure sapphire window cell it was possible to monitored any change in the liquid phase, so that the oil/water ratio could be monitored. An aliquot (60 cm3) of oil from 7/12A-01 and 7/12-7 (No. 5B) was transferred to high pressure cell maintained at 260 F. The saturation pressure of the sample was determined by measuring the pressure as function of volume. This gives direct comparison with the field conditions. true value is not necessarily required at this stage as most sets of samples are obtained from the same source, and the 'check' saturation pressure is used only to define differences between these samples. 7.2 Reservoir Fluid Analysis Reservoir fluid analyses are obtained by 'flashing' single phase sample to atmospheric pressure. The 'flashed' oil and gas are collected and analysed; these analyses are then mathamatically recombined in the correct proportions to give the composition of the reservoir fluid. Single phase reservoir fluid is flashed to atmospheric pressure across finely controlled metering valve maintained at constant temperature of 68 F. The flashed gas and oil flow through water- cooled coil at 68 F and are collected in gasometer and calibrated oil receiver respectively. The oil is kept at 68 F while the gasometer is maintained at 70 0F to prevent condensation from the gas phase. All volumes are corrected to standard conditions and the density of the gas and liquid phases are measured using calibrated vessels. The experiment is repeated several times until the GOR and densities are consistent. The errors quoted below are standard deviations from the mean of the repeated experiments and give an indication of the repeatability.FEB/15/89 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND UNCERTAINTIES 7/1 2A-01 7/1 2-7 Samples of the gas and stock tank oil are taken for analysis during the experiment. Light hydrocarbon components are identified by gas chromatography and the heavier components in the stabilised oil are characterised by simulated true boiling point curve obtained from gas liquid chromatography. The analysis of the reservoir oil is calculated by mathematically recombining the analyses of gas and liquid phases in the correct mass proportions. The experimental uncertainties in the molar analysis for each fluid are given in Tables and 7.3. 7.3 Volumetric Properties Single phase densities and volumetric properties are measured in blind high-pressure cell filled with known amounts of reservoir fluid and mercury. The cell (whose volume is accurately known as function of both temperature and pressure) is maintained at constant test temperature. Known volumes of mercury are injected into the cell and after each injection the pressure is recorded. From a knowledge of the amount of mercury in the cell and the volume of the cell at each pressure step, the density of the charge can be calculated. plot is drawn of the experimental results of pressure against density and the saturation pressure is given as the intersection of two curves. The uncertainty in saturation pressure depends greatly on the curvature of the pressure-density plot in the single phase region. The following uncertainties have been calculated at 260 F for this particular investigation.7/12A-01 7/1 2-7 Saturation pressure (psia) 1941 [5] 1687 [5] Density at saturation pressure (kg/m3) [0.6] [0.6] Density in single phase region (kg/m3) [0.2] [0.2] Derived quantities from the pressure-density experiment are relative volumes and oil compressibilities in the single phase region (Section 9.1).Wells : ULA 7/12A-01 @ 7/12-7 Table No. UNCERTAINTY OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES Experiment Property Uncertainty Reservoir Fluid Saturation Pressure 10 psi Validation Single Flash GOR per cent Gas Density per cent Oil Density per cent FVF per cent Pressure-density Saturation Pressure psi and Pressure-volume Density at p(sat) kg/m3 Density single phase kg/m3 Relative Volumes: above p(sat) per cent Compressibilities per cent PEB/15/89BP RESEARCH CENTRE SUNBURY Bottle No. : Dresser FMT Sampler Table No. UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVOIR FLUID ANALYSIS FROM WELL 7/12A-01 COMPONENT RECOMBINED RESERVOIR FLUID wt% mol% CO2 [0.02] N2 [0.03] H2 [0.01] Cl [0.16] C2 [0.06] C3 [0.07] 1C4 [0.03] nC4 [0.12] iC5 [0.07] nC5 [0.11] C5+ - C6 [0.17] C6+ - C7 [0.25] C7+ - C8 [0.14] C8+ - C9 [0.32] C9+ - C10 [0.19] C10+ - C11 [0.18] C11+ - C12 [0.20] C12+ - C13 [0.16] C13+ - C14 [0.46] C14+ - C15 [0.54] C15+ - C16 [0.44] C16+ - C17 [0.32] C17+ - C18 [0.24] C18+ - C19 [0.16] C19+ - C20 [0.09] C20+ [0.40] Benzene [0.02] Toluene [0.04] Molecular weight of C20+: 381 [12] g/molFROM WELL 7/12-7 N2 [0.02] He [0.00] Cl [0.21] C2 [0.08] C3 [0.11] 1C4 [0.04] nC4 [0.15] iC5 [0.10] hC5 [0.16] C5+ - C6 [0.27] C6+ - C7 [0.26] C7+ - C8 [0.40] C8+ - C9 [0.33] C9+ - C10 [0.25] C10+ - Cll [0.22] C11+ - C12 [0.18] C12+ - C13 [0.07] C13+ - C14 [0.18] C14+ - C15 [0.20] C15+ - C16 [0.19] C16+ - C17 [0.15] C17+ - C18 [0.15] C18+ - C19 [0.11] C20+ [0.90] Toluene [0.03] Molecular weight of C20+: 470 [12] g/molWell : 7/12A-01 Table No. DENSITIES AT 260 F - EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS PRESSURE (psia) DENSITY (kg/m3) RELATIVE VOLUME 1941(a) Note (a) Saturation Pressure FEB/15/89Well Bottle No. : : 7/12-7 Table No. Schlumberger RFT Sampler 5B DENSITIES AT 260 E - EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSWell : ULLA 7/124-01 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS- DENSITIES AT 260F Oil Density I II_I Ii PE8/15/89Oil Density (p) 1- , /V (kg/m3)PEB/15/89 CALCULATION OF VOLUMETRIC PROPERTIES 9.
