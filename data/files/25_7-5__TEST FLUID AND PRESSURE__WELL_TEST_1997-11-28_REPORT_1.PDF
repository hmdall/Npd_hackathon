The well was spudded 16.07.97 and drilled using the semi submersible drilling rig West Vanguard. On completion of drilling and logging activities, the well was production tested and permanently abandoned 30.08.97. A single oil production reservoir limits test was performed in the Hermod Formation. The test objectives in prioritised sequence were: - Determine reservoir volumes and boundary effects - Determine the productivity and reservoir properties - Obtain representative fluid samples - Determine initial reservoir conditions (P,,T) The main results from the production test are summarised below: Operation WHP (bar) WHT (C) BHP (bar) BHT (C) Oil rate (Sm3/d) Gas rate (Srn3/d) GOR (Sm3/Srn3) Initial flow 60 20 200 66 Initial build-up 70 20 202,4 64 Clean-up build-up 49 25 202 64 - During initial flow, 19,5 m3 water, diesel cushion and well fluids was returned. - Pressures and temperatures are based on last recorded results. - Flow rates are based on an average over the last hour of flow. KABTB TESTINGERONNER\250705 \POST-TESS Drilling Sector/FMUfTesting Revision : SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS Page : of 53 Run test string - test interval 4 5/8 (117,5 mm) tubing conveyed perforating guns (TCP) with big hole charges (25 gr RDX) were ran with the test string. The annulus fluid was 1,21 sg KCL mud. The test string was ran with cushion of 0,86 sg diesel from above the closed LPR-N select tester valve to surface. A RTTS retrievable packer was used to isolate the annulus. After running the bottom hole assembly, it was pressure tested to 350 bar against the closed LPR-N tester valve. The main test string, subsea equipment and landing string were ran. After landing the SSTT fluted hanger inside the BOP wear bushing, correlation run was performed on wireline prior to rigging up surface equipment, so as to check out the position of the perforating guns. After the correlation run the surface equipment was rigged up and pressure tested to 350 bar. Positioning perforating guns To position the perforating guns at the recommended depth of 2 MD RKB, the test string was picked up 2,7 meters before setting the RTTS packer by rotation of the test string. Perforation of test interval After setting the packer, correlation run was performed on wireline to re-check the depth of the perforating guns at the required perforating interval. The correlated depth was 2 MD RKB. Perforation The string was pressured up to 340 bar, the pressure held for minute, and bled back to bar to detonate the perforating guns against the closed choke manifold. After minute and 40 second delay the guns fired perforating the test interval. Initial flow and build-up After perforating the test interval, the well was opened on 24/64 adjustable choke and the flow was directed into the calibration tank. The choke opening was increased to 32/64. After filling up the calibration tank, the flow was routed into the 2nd stage separator. The well was closed in at the choke manifold when both tanks were filled up after 30 minutes initial flow period. The volume produced during the initial flow was 19,5 m3. The well remained closed at the choke manifold for planned 2,0 hour initial build-up period. 1(1.E3TB \ TESTING NBRONNER250705 \ POST-TESDrilling Sector/FMUffesting Clean-up flow and build-up During the clean-up flow, the well was flowed at choke openings between 16/64 and 48/64. During the clean-up flow period, four shut-downs occured because of process problems and problems with DA-unit. The total flowing time was hrs and 19 minutes instead of hours. The well was closed at the LPR-N tester valve for planned 4,0 hour clean-up build-up period. Main flow The [PR-N tester valve was opened against closed choke. After minutes, the well was opened for the main flow period of 96 hours on 20/64 adjustable choke (7,94 mm) The choke was increased slowly and finally set on 44/64 (17,46 mm). During the main flow period, five shut-downs occured and the main flow had to be restarted after 29,5 hours. During the new 96 hour flow period, five shut downs occurred, because of process shut-downs (PSD) and burner problems. At the end of the main flow period, the annulus pressure was bled off to zero and the LPR-N tester valve was closed for downhole main build-up. After 10 bar surface pressure drop, the choke manifold was closed, immediately after the production wing valve (PWV) was also closed. Main build-up The well was left closed at the LPR-N tester valve for 48 hr main build-up period. Surface pressure was read at the surface test tree. Minifrac A minifrac was performed on the formation prior to the killing of the well.

Halliburton had to wait over one day for some necessary equipment to be moved, even though Hydro had complained twice to the Captain. Halliburton Surface testing Unsatisfactory service - Too many inexperienced personnel were sent out. This put additional pressure on other members of the crew so as to cover all the duties required to perform good test. Management still continue to send inexperienced personnel offshore. - Offshore personnel did not check that all the equipment required for the test, was delivered to the rig or working properly. This caused lost rig time when the equipment was required. - Offshore personnel did not check out the fixed equipment properly. This caused lost rig time when the equipment was required. - Lack of spares, bad procedures and bad maintenance with some inexperienced personnel, resulted in an unsatisfactory test. - During testing 205 litres of oil was spilled into the sea.

However, number of problems still have to be addressed. The number of post incident reports (REH) was the highest to date and lost rig time was higher than for the last test (well 30/5-2). The main reasons were unexperienced personnel, bad onshore planning and bad maintenance and precheck of equipment offshore. 1. Unexperienced personnel Halliburton used too many untrained personnel who were unfamiliar with testing and equipment onboard the Hydro rigs. In the future Halliburton can not supply trainees for the testing on Hydro rigs, unless as additional personnel without cost to Hydro as they would be solely onboard for training purposes. Due to having too many untrained personnel, Halliburton required more time to check out their equipment. This in the end caused downtime, as Halliburton was unable to check out their equipment properly. Halliburton senior personnel left too many valves closed when re-starting the well after build-up, i.e. block valves downstream of back pressure control valves on the 1st and 2nd stage separators and also the gas diverter valves were closed. This is not normal practice and is very unsafe. The opening of the well should be better understood by the Halliburton crew, from the size of choke to be used to the expected flowrate with reference to the number of burner heads and compressors used. These misunderstandings resulted in that the well had to be closed in immediately after being opened and that the burners were blown out causing oil spill to the sea and downtime. 2. Bad onshore planning The Halliburton well test supervisor for this job came straight from his time off, no information was given to him prior to going offshore. The procedure books were not supplied to him. A lot of equipment, including spares, were missing on the rig prior to the test. This, in the end, caused downtime. 3. Bad maintenance and precheck of equipment offshore Offshore personnel continue to disregard procedures for checking equipment. Halliburton should look at the procedures for checking equipment and personnel offshore should follow pre test check lists more thoroughly prior to the start of operations. A: Lubricator valve control hoses Problems have been experienced in the past with lubricator valve control hoses. Lubricator valve control hose connection was damaged when made up on rig floor. This caused downtime. 2575RAP.SAM KABTEATESTINGBRONNER \250705 \ POST-TESHYDRO E&P Division Title: Final well test report, well 25/7-5 Grading : Confidential Date : 28.11.97 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Page : 52 of 53 B: Methanol pumps When the pumps were required they invariably fail to function. C: PSD system The PSD system caused lot of problems, this was due to faulty cabling. This equipment was not checked out prior to the test which in turn caused lot of downtime. D: Data acquisition unit Data acquisition unit did not operate correctly, the temperature inside the unit was far too high. This triggered PSD2 which in turn caused lot of downtime. The unit had to be overridden for the remainder of the test. E: Ignitors, pilot flares and oil burners The ignitor system for the burner heads and gas flare has to be looked into. If the pilots go out, the burner can blow itself out, this in turn causes oil spills into the sea. The gas flare can easily be blown out by the wind, and if the ignitor system does not work the gas flare cannot be re-ignited without lot of problems. F: Degassing unit downstream steam heater The degassing unit was overfilled with steam condensate during the test. The condensate in the unit covered the hydrocarbon gas detector in the unit, causing PSD 2. The gas detectors had to be overridden for the remainder of the test. A cooler should be installed upstream of the unit. Recommendations: For equipment: One person onshore should be responsible for packing equipment. completed packing list, including spare parts, should be signed by the responsible person and be sent attention Douglas Low for checking prior to being sent offshore. The list should be sent offshore with the equipment. The Halliburton well test supervisor offshore should check all equipment is received and countersign. copy of the completed list should be given to the Hydro representative offshore. A spares list for all movable testing equipment should be made for each test, standard spares list should be available for the fixed equipment on each rig. Douglas Low should be in charge of implementing and having it ready prior to the next test. For personnel: One person onshore should be responsible for supplying Hydro with the correct crew for performing it's well tests. It is his responsibility to ensure training courses are available for the Halliburton personnel. familiarisation course with Hydro equipment should be implemented for experienced well test operators who are new to the Norwegian sector. 25751RAP.SAM K BTEATESTINGBRONNER1250705 \ POST-TESSUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Page : 53 of 53 Many of the problems that occured during the production test of well 25/7-5 are the same as for previous tests. In the 25/7-5 post test meeting, Halliburton was made aware of these problems. In the pre test meeting prior to the next test, potential problems for the upcoming test will be addressed. The next test should therefore be trouble free. If however, the problems are not solved, Hydro should re-evaluate their contract with Halliburton. .... KARTS \ TESTINGUiRONNER1250705 \ POST-TES
