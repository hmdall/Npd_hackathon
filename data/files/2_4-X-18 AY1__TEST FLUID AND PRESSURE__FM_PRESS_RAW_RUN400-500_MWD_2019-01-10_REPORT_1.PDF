The data presented in this report is memory data from MWD run 400 and 500. total of tests were performed. 4 Good buildup stability 4 Fair buildup stability Good stabilization means that the pressure is stable to within psi for the last third of the build-up, P3-P2 pressures repeat to within psia. Fair stabilization means that the pressure is stable to within psi for the last third of the build-up, P3-P2 pressures repeat to within psia. Poor buildup stabilization means that the pressure is NOT stable to within 5psi for the third of the build-up (assumes reasonable build-up duration). P3-P2 pressures DO Not Repeat to better than psia. Low perm - Still building, genuine low mobility test (pulls down to close to zero or Smart threshold and builds so slowly that it would not reach stable pressure in anywhere close to reasonable time. Tight Test, genuine very low mobility test (pulls down to close to zero or Smartthreshold and builds just few 10's psi if at all. No seal means that the transient shows no drawdown evident. Lost Seal means that the transient shows drawdown and possibly of build-ups proceeds to fair stability and is then lost (premature return to Hydrostatic pressure). By definition, supercharge is the buildup of high pressure around the wellbore due to the hydrostatic head of the mud filtrate that has not dissipated after drilling. The consequence is that formation testing tools cant measure the genuine reservoir pressure which leads to inaccurate or incorrect pressure gradient, fluid contact, and formation mobility.
