Thus, steady-state conditions are usually obtained very quickly. Using the spherical flow equation of slightly compressible fluid in homogeneous medium, the drawdown mobility, (k/)d, could be expressed as follows; (10-0d = ( Cpf / Ap ) Where Ap Cpf = steady-state drawdown pressure drop = drawdown proportionality factor = pretest flow rate. The drawdown proportionality factor depends on the packer-probe configuration. Common values include:  5660 for conventional or long-nose probe and foe standard or reinforced packer.  2395 for large-diameter, 6151 Martineau probe.  1107 for large-area packer.  4857 for StethoScope675 and 825, 6266 for StethoScope475. The figure shows an example of mobility profile obtained using the sink probe. As this mobility is mainly that of drilling-damaged zone, it may not be representative of the virgin formation. However, experience indicates that it serves as good relative indicator of formation mobility True vertical depth (ft) Drawdown mobility profile obtained with single probe  Drawdown mobility (md/cp) 2010-11-11 46Drawdown Mobility from Pretest Equation Drawdown Mobility = (Drawdown proportionality factor) (Pretest Chamber Volumes) E(dT,X dP,) for all pressures < last buildup pressure Where: dT, = T1 Ti_1 dP, = Pressure at the end of the buildup - P, E(dT,X dP,) This is computed from the beginning of the first pretest to the retract cycle for all positive dP,, i.e., for all pressures less than the pressure at the end of the buildup.

These involve plotting the pressure as function of the spherical and radial time functions. The slopes of the straight-line sections are used to compute the formation parameters such as the spherical mobility, the radial mobility-thickness product, and extrapolated pressure at infinite shut-in. The proper straight-line sections for these specialized plots are the data subsets that exhibit horizontal line in the derivative curves. The below specialized plots one for Spherical and one for Radial show the ideal patterns where Spherical and Radial flow regimes have been reached during pretest. 2010-11-11 48Elapsed time (sec) Fl655Uf@ RsIa 27,6 ao5o 41.

Radial flolw diagnosis Time,sec Anytime the pressure decreases rather than increases during buildup, the derivative curve will take sharp downward dip toward negative infinity (log of negative number -infinity). Typically, such buildup is considered un- interpretable. If this occurs for short period, then the final shut-in pressure may still be good estimate of formation pressure, depending on permeability. HIGH PERMEABILITY AND MILD INSTABILITY I Storage dominated plow regim Spherical flow diagnosis diagnosis Radial fldw Turne,sec When the permeability is high, the total pressure changes seen during the buildup are small. The derivative calculation becomes more sensitive as the magnitude of the pressure changes gets near the resolution of the pressure gauge. The derivative curves may have the above wavy appearance. The true shape of the derivatives are often unclear. Good estimates of extrapolated formation pressure are still possible using simple straight line fit to the time function plots. Permeability estimates will be reasonable if the straight line fits reflect the true flow regime. 2010-11-11 50HIGH PERMEABILITY, RADIAL ONLY Pressure,psia Radial fl Radial flow diagnoses T ime,sec If the permeability is high, then the total pressure change during the buildup is small. Effects such as wellbore storage are masked. Removing the usual early hump, as high permeability infers deeper investigation, Horner radial flow is more likely to be the only flow seen. Spherical flow may be masked as well. HIGH PERMEABILITY AND DERIVATIVE INSTABILITY Co C2- CO a_ Radial flow When the permeability becomes too high for the gauge to properly resolve the resulting small pressure changes. The derivative computation becomes so unstable that flow regime recognition becomes impossible. simple straight line fit on the time function plots will yield good extrapolated pressures. But the permeability estimate may be too high. Remember the pressure changes are nearly becoming less than the gauge resolution, making the slope of the buildup inaccurate. 2010-11-11 51Schlumberger Recognizing Spherical and Horner Radial Pressure Derivative Plot Events BOTH SPHERICAL AND RADIAL FLOW I Storage dominated 1/2S row regum OS Radial I Spherical 'flow . regime I - i2S fl regime I . flow diagnosis diagnosis OS Spherical Radial fldw Classic derivative curves indicating long easily recognizable sections of both Spherical and Radial flow.

This unique system enables the StethoScope* service to make the right test-first time measurement in wide variety of formation permeabilities and mud overbalances, known or unknown, within brief drilling-transparent period of min. Unlike fixed-mode pretests, in which the rate, volume, and duration of each drawdown and buildup sequence are fixed, the TOP intelligence adjusts the sequence to the conditions encountered. This capability allows stabilized formation pressure measurements to be acquired under conditions in which fixed-mode pretests have the potential to be inconclusive due to heterogeneous formations, depletion or unknown overbalance, all within minute period.
