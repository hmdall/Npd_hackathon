PROLAB was asked to do the laboratory analyses and WEST LAB, SI and NIVA have performed the analyses. The samples were taken from choke manifold after the well had been flooding for about hrs. Due to low pressure, the water was produced with nitrogen injection. The sequences of events are given in appendix 1.Table gives the description of water analysed. The sample description from wellsite is presented in 3.2 Laboratory analysis compared with mud sample Table shows that mud has low Na, and Cl content and high SO4 concentration. The most representative sample for the formation water is the sample with highest Na, and Cl content and lowest content of SO4. 3.3 Laboratory analyses compared with wellsite analyses A comparison between wellsite analyses table and laboratory analyses table 3, shows variation in concentration of bicarbonate. These values are unstable and we will assume that the most representative value was measured in bottom hole sample opened on rig. The results is given in table and table 6. Table shows good agreement between calculated total dissolved solids and total dissolved solids correlated from density. The agreement between measured conductivity and conductivity correlated from equivalent NaC1 concentration is also good (table 5).From these observations it can be concluded that the main ions in the water samples Have been analysed. 3.5 Discussion of the results given in table Table shows that it is small variation in ion concentration in the four best water samples, no. 46, no. 47, no. and no. 25. The results of ion analyses of Na, K, Ca, and Cl are given as the average values of the four ionanalyses. Ba, Fe and SO4 are unstable ions and the results of the ionanalyses are given as the average values of the three samples with highest Ba, Fe and SO4 content. As mentioned in due to instability of concentration of HCO3 and pH, we will assume that the most representative values for the formation water at atmospheric conditions are the values given in table measured in bottom hole sample. The results of the ion analyses are given in table 6. The high barium and strontium content will in contact with seawater form BaSO4 and SrSO4. Under water injection we can expect scaling problems. A special compatability test performed on formation water from well 6506/12-5 and sea water are reported in Compatability report reference (4).TABLE Samples analysed Date hrs. Sample no.

It was performed full ion analyses on both bottom hole samples. 2.1 PETROTECHS method see appendix and It 2.2 PVT LAB's methods 2.2.1 Preparation I The high pressure bottle no. K-4120 was heated to I] res.temp. (142C) by using heating strips. The heating was performed under controlled increasing of the I pressure. The sample was stabilized at 600 barg after about 24 hrs. heating. II2.2.2 Bubble point diagram The bubblepoint measurements were performed at reservoiar temp 142C and with stepwise relaxation of pressure. The opening pressure was 188 barg. 2.2.3 Single-flash, gas composition and GWR Single-flash was performed at standard flash separator, atm. pressure and at 20C. The G.W.R. (gas water-ratio) was found by measuring the total volume gas and the weight of the water sample. Some of the gas was sampled for analysing on gas chromatograph. The rest of the sample was separated by reducing the pressure in the bottle. The water sample was sendt the lab. for analysing. pH and alkalinity were measured just after sampling. 3 RESULTS/DISCUSSION 3.1 pH measurements under reservoir pressure The result of pH measurements under reservoir pressure with stepwise relaxation to atmospheric condition, are given in table and the diagram is given in fig. 1. The result of the laboratory analysis is given in appendix 3.3.2 Bubblepoint The results from the bubblepoint measurements are Given in table and diagram fig. 3.3 Single-flash, gas composition The CO2 content in flash gas was 23 mol table 3. 3.4 GWR gas-water ratio GWR measured to sm3/m3 Density water 20C = see gas comp.4 CONCLUSION The pH at reservoir pressure is about pH units lower than at atmospheric pressure. Most of the change is due to evaporating of CO2 gas. The CO2 content in the gas was measured to be 23 mol % and this low content of CO2 must be related to the slight change in pH units. The bubble point experiment give the bubble point 103 bar for the gas in the solution, but it is not possible to tell the gas composition in the gas at pressure 103 bar and temp. 142C.kable = KNOWLEDGE Well 6506/12-5 ON SITE pH-EXPERIMENT UNDER RESERVOIR PRESSURE WITH STEPWISE RELAXATION TO ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION.

As long as the sample was kept under pressure, only small increase in the pH-value was observed. When expelling the sample to air, Petrotech detected an increase of 1,3 pH units (see fig. next page). This variation is mainly caused by evaporation of CO2. At high pressures, no significant amount of CO2 will go out of solution, but when closing up to atmospheric conditions, and by expelling the sample to air, most of the CO2 will evaporate. When measuring pH on water sampled at well head, the water has had retention time of approximately 1/2 hour. Slugged flow was also observed, due to N2 injection. As consequence of this, CO2 has been allowed to go out of solution during this time interval. If the pH values measured 1/2 hour after the B.H.S. was expel- led to air, are compared with the pH values from water sampled at well head, the values are quite similar. Example : Bottom Hole Sample Well head sample 6,7 (average) 1/2 pH Delta 6,6 1/2 hrs These observations should be noticed, and Petrotech recommend that when producing from water zone, Bottom Hole Sampling should be performed, in order to measure the right pH value and other propertiesa   =  KNOWLEDGE Well 6506/12-5 ON SITE pH-EXPERIMENT UNDER RESERVOIR PRESSURE WITH STEPWISE RELAXATION TO ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION.
