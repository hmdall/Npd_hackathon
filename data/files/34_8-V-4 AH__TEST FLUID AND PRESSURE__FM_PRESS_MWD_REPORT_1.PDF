GeoTap Pressure Analysis Report Well : 34/8-V-4 AH Customer : Statoil Processed by : Rob Date : Jan, 2012Table of Contents Cover Page Table of Contents Discussion Log Presentation Pressure Test Summary Test Parameter Summary Pressure Depth Plot vs. Run 1500 - GeoTap Test Build-up detail Run 1500 - GeoTap Test 10 Run 1500 - GeoTap Test 12 Run 1500 - GeoTap Test 14 Run 1500 - GeoTap Test 16 Build-up detail Run 1600 - GeoTap Test 18 Run 1600 - GeoTap Test GeoTap Report - Statoil : 34/8-V-4 AH PageSummary Sperry's GeoTap tool was used on MWD run 1500 in the 12.25in 13.5in hole section; and the GeoTap on run 1600 in the section on Visund Sr well 34/8-V-4 H. 5 tests were attemted on run 1500 and all were successful. The tests had triple drawdowns with cc/sec drawdown rate, 10cc drawdown volume and 224 sec build-up time. All tests have excellent buildup stability. 6 tests were attempted on run 1600. All tests have invalid draw-downs. In real-time test seemed to be valid but on further investigation of the memory data also has invalid draw-downs. All tests were performed with pumps on. No correlation run was done prior to testing, so no depth shifting was performed. All pressures are atmospheric pressure.
