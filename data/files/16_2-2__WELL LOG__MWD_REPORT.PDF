The first well in the block, 16/2-1, was drilled by Esso as early as 1967 and proved 50m oil column in chalk reservoir. The objective of well 16/2-2 was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Skuld prospect in favourable position with respect to reservoir development and likely oil water contact. The 17 1/2 hole section were drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills (5-10m3) pumped whenever required. Baker Hughes lNTEQ provided the MWD and LWD service: IVTPR service with resistivity and gamma, and directional/vibrational data. The section was drilled in one run. RUN # 205m - 1312m ROTARY ASSEMBLY A new Hughes MX Ti bit with 2x20 and lx16 nozzles, was made up to Bill MWD Suite including Modular Directional Collar (SIN 2806-15) , and 'A Multiple Propagation Sub (S/N 27515). Please refer to the BHA record for more detailed information. The MWD suite was electrically tested at surface to specifications. Typical drilling parameters for this run was: WOB: 0-11 t., average ROP: 72 m/hrs, SPP: 236 bar, Flow: 3990, Torque: kNm and RPM: 120. There where taken 13 surveys during the run. We also delivered HST Advantage Combinatorial service (0.36) for this run and the decoding was very good. 1312m - 1312m ROTARY ASSEMBLY A Diamond Products Intenation sin 1964094 bit with 9x10 nozzles, was made up to Bill MWD Suite including 3/4 Modular Directional Collar (SIN 6034-14) with pressure readings, and 3A Multiple Propagation Sub (SM. 6009). Please refer to the BHA record for more detailed information. The MWD suite was electrically tested at surface to specifications, but failed flow test at 930m. The string was pulled out to change the Modular Directional Collar. 1312m - 1634m ROTARY ASSEMBLY A Diamond Products Intenation sin 1964094 bit with 9x10 nozzles, was made up to BHT MWD Suite including 3A Modular Directional Collar (SIN 1669-08) with pressure readings, and 3A Multiple Propagation Sub (SIN 6009). Please refer to the BHA record for more detailed information. The MWD suite was electrically tested at surface to specifications. However, the resistivity sub failed when drilling float and cement. It was decided to continue to drill without gamma and resistivity, but the string was pulled before potential coring point and the MWD Suite was changed. Typical drilling parameters for this run was: WOB: 0-5 tonnes, average ROP: 46 mihrs, SPP: 230 bar, Flow: 2500, Torque: 3-8 kNm and RPM: 80-130. There where taken surveys during the run.1634m - 1880m ROTARY ASSEMBLY A Diamond Products Intenation s/n 1964094 bit with 9x10 nozzles, was made up to BM MWD Suite including 3/4 Modular Directional Collar (SIN 6160-11) with pressure readings, and 3/4 Multiple Propagation Sub (S/N 6550). Please refer to the BHA record for more detailed information The MWD suite was electrically tested at surface (to specifications), and drilled to TD without problems. Typical drilling parameters for this run was: WOB: 1-5 tonnes, average ROP: 22 m/hrs, SPP: 210 bar, Flow: 2300, Torque: 2-10 k.Nm and RPM: 90-130.

The final surveys are calculated using Baker Hughes INTEQ MSS program. MSS is software package for use on any computer connected via real time computer link to standard Bill surface system providing commercial Directional-RAW (D-RAW) service. The MSS processed data is corrected for magnetic drill string interference, where our algorithm MAGCORR #1 I-rZ comas the readings for axial magnetic interference. The SAG programme calculates the bottom hole assembly sag (or flexure), and how it affects the directional measurements. The program outputs an ASCII file containing table of inclination and correction values. This file is read by the MSS program and the SAG correction can be applied automatically. The SAG program (version 1.10) will calculate the BHA sag based on two dimensional (2-D) input. The program output has been tested versus the more complex 3-D version, and found to calculate SAG correction with acceptable accuracy. SAG correction is applied on all Bill MWD runs, providing the inclination is above degrees. No gravity correction has been performed. SURVEY REPORTS / DIGITAL DATA: Various directional data listings are included: 1) General MWD Survey Information This is listing of the job specific data, such as customer information, well information, general correction information. The mnemonics used in this listing are listed below: Mnemonic Description DIPN Nominal local value for total magnetic field strength HTN Nominal local value for total magnetic dip angle GTN Nominal local value for total gravitational field strength Note that the survey rounding is toggled to ON. This implies that the inclinations and azimuths on the Final Survey Listing(s) are rounded to nearest 1/10 of degree. All other listings are rounded to 1/100 of degree. Although the displayed resolution of all surveys is to the nearest 1/10 or 1/100 of a degree, internal resolution of all numbers and calculations is carried out using double precision floating point numbers.2) Full Survey Listing This is listing containing all relevant data about every survey. This list is primarily targeted at survey experts in BIII and the oil company, and is used for quality control and trouble shooting.

The Z-components point in the direction of the drill string. Also listed is the calculated GTB, G-Total-Base, which is the root mean square of the gravitometer readings.Theoretically GTB should be exactly equal to the nominal local value for the total gravitational field strength, GTN. Similarly, the calculated HTB, H-Total-Base, should read the same as the nominal local value for total magnetic field strength, HTN, if no drill string interference were present. An asterisk (*) for the quality flags for GTB and HTB value indicates that these values are deviating from the nominal values by gravity and gauss, respectively. An asterisk in the GTB-QF column indicates an erratic survey, i.e. the calculated GTB is out with 0.003 gravity of the nominal gravitational field strength. This can be due to drill string vibration, movement of the drill pipe when the directional survey measurements are acquired, or sensor related problem. An asterisk in the HTB-QF column does not necessarily mean that the survey is not valid, because this data has not been run through the MSS program yet. On the contrary, the asterisk indicates that these surveys have to be corrected using MSS algorithm in order to achieve reliable results. After correction, the HT (total magnetic field) value should be closer to the nominal value, HTN (the rejection criterion is deviation of gauss), than before correction. If the difference is larger than the criteria, the measurements are erratic or external (non-drill string) interference could have been present. This is indicated on the listing by an asterisk in the HT-QF column. Our axial magnetic drill string correction algorithm is called MAGCORR #1 HZ, and uses the BGGM (Global Geomagnetic Model from British Geological Survey) values of Earth's Magnetic Dip Angle (DIPN) and Earth's Total Magnetic Field Strength (HTN) to compute new value of HZ. This value is then used in the survey calculations instead of the transmitted base value HZBX. The algorithm has singularity for INCBS=90 and AZIVI=90 (or 270 2), and because of the uncertainty in DP?N and HTN the uncertainty of this correction increases rapidly when this angle is approached. Due to this the MAGCORR #1 HZ algorithm is usually not used when INCBS>602and AZN1 is in the corridor of due east/west < 30g. In this situation Non-Magnetic spacing is used to minimise the drill string interference, and the base value HZBX is used in the final surveys. The sag corrected inclination (INCBS) and Final Grid azimuth (AZGC) of this listing is used for calculation of the wellbore position. 3) DIRECTIONAL SURVEY CALCULATIONS This is listing of the posted corrected surveys, with wellbore position calculations using minimum curvature method included.
