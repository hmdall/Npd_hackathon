This was the third appraisal pilot hole drilled on Heidrun Nord after the exploration well 6507/8-4, which was placed in fault segment 1. The primary objective of the well was to verify oil and the fluid contacts in segment #1, secondary objectives were to identify the stratigraphy, especially the exact base re sand, and to investigate the reservoir properties. The entire well was drilled as an 1/2 hole in bit runs. The first runs with PDC bits, both balled up, the third bit was a roller cone bit drilling the Springar Formation. For the fourth bit run, PDC bit was used for drilling in the re formation.

The fifth bit run to TD was also made using PDC bit. The well TD was at MD (2273.3 TD RT). From the 13 3/8 casing shoe, the hole inclination was built from 56 deg. to the sail angle of 90 deg at 2610 m. Dog legs were ranging from s again to 93 deg. and the well was drilled along the planned well path . Top re reservoir came in at 2608 MD and top re sand at 2697 m. The reservoir sands were gas -filled down to approximately 2885 MD ( TVD RT). The first oil bearing sand was encountered at approximately 2913 MD (2150.4 TVD RT) after crossing the fault between segment and segment 1. With the exception of possible thin gas zone encountered at 2990 MD (2157.1 TVD RT), the remainder of the sands drilled were oil bearing down to the oil- water contact found at approximately 3505 MD (2252.6 TVD RT). 2.2 deg to max deg. Because of low ROP and no and, inclination was dropped to 86 deg and held there until the re sand was penetrated.

Bit was changed to another and similar type of PDC bit. BHI's new density/neutron (ORD/CCN) was put in the BHA in addition to the other tools from the first run. Ran in hole and continued drilling. Drilled down to 2428 MD, 67 meters in 17 hours, had less than 1,5 m/hr the last hours of drilling. Pumped glycol pill and retracted bars of AutoTrak without any observed increase in ROP. Decided to POOH. Pipe got stuck for 10 minutes at 2398 MD. Came free by pushing the pipe down and by rotating. Also this bit was balled up with claystone. Ran in hole and continued drilling with rock bit and the rest of the same 1/2 BHA from previous runs. The ROP in the Springar Formations were ~10 m/hr with rock bit, decreasing towards 2-3 m/hr approaching the reservoir. Drilled 18 into the reservoir before BHA was pulled out of hole. Tight hole from 2476 to 2450m MD. Back reamed from 2403 to 2336 and hole packed of at 2403, 2395 and 2365m MD. On drill floor all memory data was dumped, battery changed in the ADN tool while the bit was replaced. The AutoTrak and the CCN tool were replaced in the BHA. Drilled ahead with extremely low ROP <3 m/hr, and got drill break @ 2647 m, ROP >30 m/hr. ROP decreased, and further section was drilled with ROP ~3 m/hr. Got drill break at 2697 m. Continued drilling with controlled ROP lower than 30 m/hr for data quality. Got problems with increased pump pressure probably due to the pulsing sub in the AutoTrak. Eventually the sub failed, stands further were drilled, and the bit was pulled to replace the AutoTrak. The memory was dumped from the MWD tools and the bit and the AutoTrak were changed out. This new assembly was then run in hole and drilling continued from 3114 to TD at 3562 MD. A water based mud with weight 1,48 sg was used to drill the 1/2 hole.

HYDROCARBON INDICATIONS Entering the reservoir, gas readings went up from approx. 0.1% background gas to 0,1-1,0% and later up to maximum peak value of 14 % the reservoir. gas while drilling through the gas zone. Background gas decreased again to below 3% while drilling throughDate Rev. no. 11 of 35 The samples had dull to bright, even-spotty yellowish fluorescence and occasional blue-white cut fluorescence from 2600 m MD to 3500 MD. The logs indicated that the reservoir sands were gas -filled down to approximately 2885 MD ( TVD RT). The first oil bearing sand was encountered at approximately 2913 MD (2150.4 TVD RT) after crossing the fault between segment and segment 1. With the exception of possible thin gas zone encountered at 2990 MD (2157.1 TVD RT), the remainder of the sands drilled were oil bearing down to the oil-water contact. The logs show oil down to 3502 MD and water up to 3512 MD. This was confirmed by the disappearance of shows between the samples taken at HOLE STABILITY 3500 MD and 3510 MD. Most likely OWC is around 3505 MD (2252,6 TVD RT). No cavings were observed drilling through the Cretaceous claystone, but had tight hole when pulling out at 2626 TD depth. Had to work string free at 2476 and back reamed out to shoe. Had traces of cavings when starting drilling again from 2626 m. Cavings where of different shape and size 10 - 25 mm long. Dominantly 10x3x2 mm, tabular or splintery, occ sharp and made of dk gry-olv gry claystone. After drilling to TD an attempt was made to re-log section of hole at 2384 MD. Problems were experienced here with the string packing off. Otherwise no notable hole problems were observed while pulling out prior to plugging back the hole. MUD SYSTEM A Glydrill water based system was used DIRECTIONAL SUMMARY to drill this section. The section was drilled with g/cm3 mud. Hole inclination was 56 at the 13 3/8 casing shoe. The AutoTrak equipment performed well building angle and landing the well horizontally at 2597.5m MD @2147,3 TVD. Because of very low ROP and no indication of main sand, the inclination was dropped down to 86 deg until top of sand in re 1.13. Started then to increase inclination and had 92 2778 MD. Thereafter, the hole angle was gradually dropped to follow the planned well path. At 2480 MD it was desired to drop angle as quickly as possible to find the oil/water contact. The angle was abruptly dropped from degrees at 3468 m MD to deg. at TD. Again, the AutoTrak showed exceptional ability to make fast changes in hole inclination. deg atSUMMARY REPORT HNO HD PTEK 0049 Date Rev. no. 12 of 35 MWD Anadrill LWD = DEN/NEU (ADN in memory only) Baker Hughes Inteq; AutoTrak with GR/RES/DEN/NEU (ORD/CCN) Run No. Tool Combination Logged Interval (m bit depth) Formation Bit to sensor distances in meters RES DIR GR DEN / NEU Circ.

Run no 2: BHI DEN/NEU (ORD/CCN) was included in the string to give real time data. Run no Bakers neutron sub failed and gave wrong data. The sub was changed. On surface starting wash out in Anadrills ADN was seen and the tool changed out. One 20 section re-logged on way out to evaluate tool problem. Run no and 5: Baker requested to log two sections on the way out to check the tool failure on the previous run, and to re-log readings in clean gas sand. Some problems with the Baker pulsing sub experienced while drilling with high ROP. Some real-time data points lost due to this problem. Anadrill's ADN was run with different source than the tool had been calibrated with. This led to erroneous log readings and the need to reprocess the data after re-calibration of the tool onshore.

The pipe was jarred free after hour and circulation was established. Pulled into casing, and while reaming the rat hole, indications showed damaged or deformed casing shoe. Continued to ream until it was possible to enter the csg.shoe without taking extra weight. The top drive was inspected and AutoTrak tested prior to continue drilling. Drilled down to 2428 MD, the hole packed off. The string was worked free and pulled up into 13 3/8 casing. The rat hole was reamed several times before drilling continued. The average ROP in Springar down to 2125 TVD ( the upper 3/4 of the Springar formation was approx. 12-15 m/hr. In the last 1/4 of the Springar the average ROP was 1-5 m/hr. The reservoir section was drilled with highly variable ROP, but mainly in the range of 10-25 m/hr. From 2428 MD (2123,9 TVDRT) in the Springar Formation to section TD in the re Fm at 2882,3 MD (2182,5 TVDRT) there were no drilling problems. 1.13 are oil filled. Top re was picked at 2569 MD (2165,9 TVDRT). It is poor quality reservoir, it might have one thin oil filled sand. From 2605 MD (possible re 1.11) there is high quality reservoir with gas. All sands are gas filled; with exception of thin sand lens from 2762-2765 MD which is oil filled. From 2837 to 2844 MD is shale layer, and from 2844 MD is the first high quality reservoir sand with oil. The sealing fault between segment #2 and #1 was therefore interpreted to be between 2837 and 2844 MD. Section TD was 30 MD from the fault plus meters rat hole, which means 2882 MD.

Towards base of the formation occasionally greyish black cuttings can be seen. Cuttings shape is dominantly blocky to subblocky, with some intervals of sticky firm and slightly silty claystone. The rock is occasionally slightly calcareous and contains traces of microcrystalline pyrite. The claystone become less silty/ sandy with depth. Limestone: The limestone is commonly white in colour grading into various shade of light grey (light olive grey, light brownish grey). Cuttings shape of limestone is commonly amorphous, but becomes blockier in the lower 20 TVD of the Springar Fm. Cuttings hardness varies from soft to moderately firm accordingly.

Some andstone: Indications of sandstone in cuttings are predominantly seen as loose quartz grains, clear and translucent commonly seen in within the finest sandstones. Occasionally good traces of mica are observed (e.g. in re reservoir unit). C laystone: Claystone cuttings (mainly in re and re 1.10) are commonly grey and olive grey to olive black in colour. Cuttings fragments are subblocky to amorphous in shape and commonly soft and sticky although minor amounts of moderately firm fragments are observed. Most claystone cuttings are calcareous and slightly to moderately silty. Traces of microcrystalline pyrite inclusions can be observed. C oal: few coal beds are penetrated in this section. Coal cuttings particles observed from these beds are black to brownish black in colour. The particles are commonly blocky in shape and disintegrate into angular fragments, which is an indication of brittle material. However substantial portion of the coal particles are moderately firm and becomes deformed between the tweezers arms. Limestone: Minor proportions of limestone (dolomite?) are seen as small and often highly disintegrated cuttings particles. Limestone particles are commonly white to light yellowish grey in colour, but also some darker yellowish brown limestone occurs in the re Fm. The limestone cuttings are commonly subblocky in shape, and soft to firm in hardness. Most limestone particles are argillaceous and disintegrate into microsucrosic texture.

The reservoir section (re Formation) was drilled with ROPs in the range of 20-30 m/hr. Oil-filled sands were encountered in the first 650 meters of the well, down to 3550 MD. Gas-filled sands interbedded with some oil-filled sands were found in the next 445 metres of the well, down to 4069 MD. Water-filled sands were found in the last 270 meters of the well, this interval includes the northernmost segment of the Heidrun North. Because of the presence of gas and the water-filled sands, it was decided to cement back the entire section to the 5/8 casing shoe and drill new pilot, E-3 DH to complete as the oil producer in Heidrun North, segment #1.GEOLOGICAL AND PETROPHYSICAL SUMMARY REPORT PILOT WELLS&RE PRODUCER Doc. no.

During drilling of the shoe track, the well was displaced from 1,48 sg mud to 1,22 sg Glydrill mud. After drilling out the 5/8 casing shoe, the well encountered shale after having drilled few meters of oil-filled sandstone. To increase the chances for finding the productive re 1.12-1.13 sands, the well path was geosteered upwards to TVD above the planned path by building the well path inclination from at 2915 MD up to degrees at 2960 MD. At 2960 MD the well path was dropped to 89 degrees from here to 3045 MD where the well dropped gradually to degrees at 3160 MD. total of 160 meters of oil-filled re 1.12-1-13 sand (at 3045 MD) was encountered during the geosteering. The well path came back onto the original well path at 3273 MD From 3625 MD (2184.5 TVDMSL) to 3680 MD (2185.5 TVDMSL) clearly gas-filled sand was encountered, and it was later decided to lower the well path 10 TVD to obtain more distance to gas-oil-contact. From 3895 MD (\2188.8 TVDMSL) the well path was dropped with max. dogleg of deg/30 m, and the well path was back to degrees at 4070 MD. ROP was restricted to 25 m/hr (5 aver.) and 30 m/hr instantaneous to ensure good real-time log quality from 2881 to 2902 m MD whilst geosteering upwards. The ROP for the rest of the well was restricted to 30 m/hr (5 aver.) and 50 m/hr instantaneous to ensure good quality memory log data. In the interval 5 MD the real time log quality was very poor with many gaps, and it was decided to return to down linking the auto track off bottom to improve the log quality (less gaps). There were several downlinks in this interval due to the drop of the well path. The well encountered re just outside the 5/8 csg.shoe. The well crossed down into re at 2905 MD. Top re is interpreted at 3080 MD, meaning over 150 of re sand was encountered. From 3095 MD (top re 1.9) claystone with thin sands and occasional carbonaceous shales was drilled. Occasional gas peaks (up to 40%) are most likely related to carbonaceous shales/shales and the generation of coal gas, e.g. at 3167 MD. Formation tops were picked at the well site. The offset wells 6507/8-E-3 BH and 6507/8-4 were used as correlation wells. From 3625-3680 MD gas separation occurred on the density/neutron logs, and gas peaks were in the order of 13-14%. After drilling break at 3772 m, max. gas peak of 77,6 % was registered. connection occurred at 3770 MD, so the high gas could also be connection gas, indicating pore pressure higher than the expected 1.06-1.08 sg EMW. Several other high gas readings coinciding with connections were recorded from 3770 MD to TD. Gas filled sands were observed in the intervals: 3 MD 4 MD Possible gas filled sands were observed: The first water filled sand, with resistivity of 0,8 ohmm, came in at 4070 MD (2202.7 TVDMSL).

At 4142-4144 MD the gas readings increased to 66 %.

The first 10 min stop gave gas peak of 76% and the second stop gave gas peak of 47%. No gas was observed in the well while pumping with sg mud and 21points ECD (total EMW= could be as high as sg, and that mud weight should be raised. 1.43 sg). It was therefore concluded that pore pressure Mud weight was increased to sg and drilling continued. Since the well now had encountered several gas filled sand zones, it would have to be cemented back to seal off these zones, so tit was therefore decided to drop the well path to get information about the fluid system and stratigraphy in the northernmost se dropped from degrees at 4250 MD to degrees at 4340 MD. gment of Heidrun North. and this well path was TD criterion was to prove clearly water-filled sands before terminating the well. The real time MWD data were unfortunately of extremely poor quality in this section of the well, and the last two stands had to be reamed and relogged to get readable log. Torque and Stick Slip values increased at the end of the well section, and connection gas values remained high. second 10- 10-10 mud test was performed at TD, with gas peak of 36% gas at the first pump off interval and 37 % on the last. Mud weight was then increased to 1,29 sg before performing third 10-10-10 test. Unfortunately the gas trap was placed too low in the header box prior to the returns, and the first arrival was not registered. The trap was arrival (0,5%). The mud weight was then raised to 1,35 to compensate for the riser margin. raised in time to register the last At first it was attempted to pump out of the hole but back reaming became necessary soon after starting to pull out. In particular the interval 3600 MD to 3050 MD encountered tight hole, ledges, pack off, increase in standpipe pressures and reduced circulation occurred. Very often over pull and tight hole indications coincided with stabilizers crossing coal stringers and hard ledges/cemented intervals. Pack off was most likely due to cuttings being left in hole, i.e. insufficient hole cleaning. few mechanical cavings were observed, probably torn/beaten loose from the borehole wall by the action of the BHA w/stabs. small but shakers when back reaming.

The major lithology in these reservoir units is fine to medium sandstones or occasionally coarse sandstones. In addition claystones and occasional coal beds are observed. The claystone is often very carbonaceous, sometimes grading to coal. True coals are only rarely encountered Sandstone: Predominantly seen as loose desegregated quartz grains, clear and translucent to transparent , rarely pink or yellow in colour and luster. Grain size grades from very fine to occasionally coarse sand. Sorting is mainly moderate but occasionally the sand is well sorted. Grain texture is commonly subangular to subrounded. The sands contain traces of mica and pyrite, and abundant mica occur at intervals in the lower part of the hole section. Claystone: Claystone cuttings are dark grey and olive grey in the upper part of the section, changing to olive black and very dark grey in the lower half of the section. Cuttings fragments are subblocky to amorphous, non-to slightly calcareous and slightly to moderately silty. Claystones are commonly micromicaceous and traces of microcrystalline pyrite inclusions be observed. From approximately re at 3362 MD the claystone is dominantly very dark grey to black and very carbonaceous, grading to coal. The fragments can be slightly silty, subblocky to fissile, slightly calcareous in parts, with abundant microcrystalline pyrite and fine laminas of finely disseminated pyrite. At the very end of the section, grey to light brownish grey claystones occur. These claystones are soft, occasionally amorphous, but also fissile and non calcareous. an Coal: Several Coal beds are penetrated in this section, especially from re (3362 MD) and below. Coal cuttings particles observed from these beds are black to brownish black in colour. Coal fragments are commonly subbl shape, firm to hard and brittle. The cleavages have shiny luster and the coals are occasionally pyritic. HYDROCARBON INDICATIONS ocky to blocky LWD logs indicate that the reservoir sands are oil-filled from the 5/8 casing shoe at MD, to 3582 MD. Formation gas peaks from to 15 % were detected 3-4 times pr. 100 meters in this interval, while the background gas in general was less then 2.5%. The largest gas peak in this interval was 39.6%, and was observed at 3167 MD, corresponding to coal layer. Many of the gas peaks are as result of coal gas generation. appear to be related to carbonaceous claystones/coals suggesting that these gas peaks From 3772 MD, high gas peaks in the range of 30 - 80 %, C1 to C5, started to occur. At least from 4055 MD, these gas peaks were identifi in the range of 2-5%. ed as connection gases, which led to an increased mud weight. The background gas was usually LWD logs were indicated oil-filled reservoir down to 3582 MD, and gas-filled sands from 3625 MD and down to 4034 m MD. Water was connection gases. first indicated on the logs from 4069 MD, strangely enough coinciding with the first occurrence of the Hydrocarbon shows were difficult to identify due to the desegregated nature of the host grains. Occasional shows indicate moderate to even yellow fluorescence and fast blooming cut fluorescence.Date Rev. no. 27 of 35 HOLE STABILITY The mud weight through most of the section was sg. No stability problems were observed in the upper part of the section. The close depth correlation of high gas peak and observed coal/carbonaceous claystone on the logs at 3167m MD indicated an in-gauge hole. Examination of the recorded gas peaks, suggested that the first gas peak associated with connection may have occurred as early as 3770 MD, but connection gas was definitely present from 4055 MD, and continued to occur on every stand to TD. During one connection, connection gas was registered as low as %, but this may have been related to the position of the bit, which at the time was 20 meters into shale. Background gas varied from to %. Mud weight was raised in steps, initially from sg to sg at 4168 MD, which at first seemed to suppress the gas amplitudes. Consequently the pore pressure in this section of the hole was believed to be below or close to 1.22. Connection gases increased however, and the mud weight was raised again to sg at 4315 MD. Mud weight was increased to at 4340 MD/2236,5 TVD. The response to the last 10-10-10 mud test was down to 1,1 % gas. Hence the pore pressure was interpreted to be close to 1,26 sg but less than 1,29 at the toe of the well bore. The mud weight was raised to sg prior to pulling out of MUD SYSTEM the hole to compensate for the riser margin. A Glydrill water based system was used to drill this section. The CaCO3 content was kept high throughout the section to prevent mud losses to the formation because of overbalance. The well was initially displaced from g/cm3 while drilling out the shoe track ,and the section down to 4168 MD drilled with sg mud. From 4168 the mud weight was raised to 1.24 sg, and at 4315m MD, the mud weight was raised again to increased pore pressure. Mud weight was again increased to at 4340 MD. The mud weight was again increased to 1.35 sg prior to pull out of hole to compensate for the riser margin. .26 sg to compensate for connection gas and supposedly DIRECTIONAL SUMMARY After drilling out the 5/8 shoe, the 1/2 hole was started with an inclination of 90 deg., whilst turning left. As shale was encountered, the inclination was built to 96 deg. from 2915-2960 MD. At 2960 MD the well was in sand and inclination was therefore dropped to 90 deg. from here to 3045 MD. The azimuth in this section was turned left from 76 deg. at the 5/8 casing shoe to deg. From here the well was dropped and turned towards the original planned well path. drop from 90 to deg. was made from 3045-3160m MD with turn from to 55 deg, and at 3273 MD well path was back on original plan with deg incl. and 54 deg azimuth. Since gas filled sands had been encountered, it was decided to lower the well path 10 TVD from 3895 MD ( TVDMSL). The well path was dropped with max. dogleg of deg/30 m, and the well path was back to degrees at 4070 MD. Total dogleg severity was restricted to deg./30m during the build to 96 deg. and deg./30m from then on. However, surveys show resultant dogleg severities of up to deg./30m until 3102 MD. At 4250 MD , the well path was dropped in order to locate the oil water contact in the far end segment of the Heidrun Nord structure and to achieve some stratigraphic control. The deviation was changed from 89,50 at 4250 MD to 76,50 at 4340 MD.Date Rev. no. 28 of 35 MWD Baker Hughes Inteq; AutoTrak withGR/RES/DEN/NEU (ORD/CCN) and PWD (pressure while drilling) Run No. Tool Combinations Logged Interval (m bit depth) Formation Bit to sensor distances in meters RES DIR GR DEN / NEU Circ. Time (hrs) Comments GENERAL COMMENTS: Real-time: Decoding problems were encountered in the first few meters of drilling, but were not significant problem subsequently, although occasional decoding problems were encountered below 4170 MD resulting in data gaps. The cause of this was believed to be noise problems, specifically from mud pump no. 3. This pump was then stopped, and pump and was run on split rate, which seemed to function best with respect to pulsing. Pulses became weaker towards the TD of the well, especially below 4282 MD and the tool failed to function while the bit was drilling, and relogging had to be carried out when bit was off bottom, which meant logging while reaming on the last two stands. The log quality was then acceptable to establish water zone. n the first half of the hole section the real time log quality was acceptable, but whether noise or tool failure, the real time log quality in the second half of the section was below standard. The real time logs in this part were barely of sufficient quality to be used as tool for geosteering. This has to be looked into with respect to near future operation in this area. At some stage it was als created gaps in the log that, dependent upon the ROP, also reduced the quality of the log. At the end of the section it was decided to do the down future wells in the area.

Drilling resumed after 49 hours, when the shoe was drilled out and the mud-system replaced from 1.35 to sg. The rat hole was drilled from 2872m MD and time-drilling for the kick-off was done from 2888m to 2907m. Cement was softer in the rat-hole than in the casing, seen from both ROP and cuttings samples, which were taken every 1m to define when the new hole was drilled.

Observed similar log responses as seen in the E-3 CH well, from shale followed by an oil filled sand. Pump rate had to be increased at every drilling stop to keep the AutoTrak pulsing but the tool eventually failed at 2913m MD (probably due to electric failure at 19.02.2001 18:27).

This limit was, however, exceeded in some sands. The last 20 to TD were drilled carefully with 15 m/hr to ensure recognition of the top re coals in time to halt drilling. The string was pumped out of the hole from 3191 to 2852 MD, and back reaming was required from 3125 to 3126 MD. POOH was unproblematic for the rest of the hole.

Formation gas peaks from to % were detected times from 2927-3191m MD, while the background gas was less then 2.6% throughout. gas peak of % at 2927 MD was probably caused by swabbing. Hydrocarbon shows were often poor due to the disaggregated nature of the host grains, but they generally indicate patchy to even, pale to moderate yellow fluorescence and slow blooming cut fluorescence.

The 12 1/4 section was initially drilled with g/cm3 mud, and the previous 1/2 section down to 4340 MD was ended with g/cm3 mud, due to high reservoir pressure in the deeper parts of the well. This mud system was displaced with g/cm3 mud at the 5/8 shoe before drilling new formation All downlinks to the AutoTrak were performed off bottom, in order to achieve the best possible real-time logs for geosteering. After drilling out the 5/8 shoe, the 1/2 hole was started with an inclination of deg., whilst turning right to kick off into new well path. After the new hole was confirmed, it was drilled with 90 deg. inclination with turn from 77 to 75 deg. From c.2970-3176 MD inclination was dropped to and the well turned to 60 deg. azimuth.

This was the third pilot hole drilled on Heidrun Nord after exploration well 6507/8-4, which was placed in fault segment 1. The primary objective of the well was to verify oil and fluid contacts in segment 1, secondary objectives were to identify the stratigraphy, especially the exact base re sand, and to investigate the reservoir properties. The planned logging programme was LWD The purpose of the logging was geological zonation, petrophysical evaluation and verification of fluid contacts. Optional pipe-conveyed pressure measurement was planned, depending of the resulting pressure measurement obtained in 6507/8-E-3 AH. Use of rotary steerable drilling assembly resulting in Baker AutoTrack being used, providing gamma-ray and resistivity logs. Also baker ORD/CCN had to be used to provide real-time density/neutron log. Because Baker ORD/CCN had not been qualified for quantitative use in Statoil, Schlumberger ADN was run in memory. The ORD/CCN logs were only provided real- time. Memory logs delivered were from Baker ATK and Schlumberger ADN. 1.2 Logging operations The optional pressure measurement planned was cancelled. Schlumberger LWD is described further in 1.2.1 and Baker LWD in 1.2.2. The optional WL logging was cancelled. G:\UPN\HNO_Heidrun\PETEK\66 Brnn\E-3 BH\663 Petrofysikk\Petrofysikk rapport E-3 BH, CH, DH.doc1.2.1 Logging job no.1 The first logging job is the Schlumberger ADN logs (DEN/NEU). The tool was run together with Baker AutoTrack (ATK) in the fist run and with Baker ATK/ORD/CCN in the following runs (Table 1-1). The first run was terminated at 2361 MD when the Baker ORD/CCN tools had arrived at the rig and was to be added to the BHA. Due to lost ROP, the second run was terminated at 2428 MD. After pulling out of hole, the bit proved to be balled up with clay. On the third run, the Baker neutron sub failed and gave wrong data. On surface starting wash out of Schlumberger ADN was seen, and both the CCN and ADN was changed. On the fourth run the pulsing sub on the Baker ATK failed and the bit was pulled to replace the ATK. The fifth run was drilled to TD. On the fourth and fifth run, the Schlumberger ADN was run with different source than the tool had been calibrated with. This lead to erroneous log readings, and the logs had to be reprocessed after re-calibration of the tool onshore. For the field logs, the density curve was shifted by 0.3 g/cc.

The plan was to run ATK/ORD/CCN providing real-time data and Schlumberger ADN in memory, since Baker ORD/CCN tools had not been qualified for quantitative use. Due to delay in the mobilisation of the ORD/CCN tools, the drilling started off with only ATK/ADN. When the tools arrived at the rig, the BHA was pulled out of the hole and the ORD/CCN added to the tool string. The following bit runs are described in the previous section ( 1.2.1). Table 1-2 Logging job no. 2000-09-25 MWD/LWD Baker1.3 Petrophysical evaluation 1.3.1 Raw curves Baker ORD/CCN was run in this well, but only for real-time logging. Only ATK memory data was delivered. The Baker gamma-ray/resistivity logs is used together with Schlumberger density/neutron (ADN) logs. Log quality is generally good, except in the gas filled formations where the low neutron porosity makes it difficult to pick up coal layers, and shoulder beds are affected by the measurements in gas zones. All the raw curves are listed in Table 4-1 in 0. 1.3.2 Composite curves The composite curves used for input to the evaluation model are listed in Table 4-4 in 0. The choice of raw curves is given as remark in the same table. The composite curves are splice of the logs from the different bit runs. Some manual editing has been done on the resistivity curve (RT) to remove artificial spikes in the log. 1.3.3 Processing A coal flag curve is generated using default cut-off values for RHOB and NPHI. few coal layers are not picked up by this routine because the neutron porosity is too low. This is mostly due to shoulder bed effects from low neutron layers. To pick up these layers, the NPHI curve has been edited manually to have neutron value above the default cut-off value in the coal_flag routine. The resulting curve is pef_NPHI. However, at 2736 MD and 2749 MD there are two spikes of low density where the neutron values are too low to exceed the coal flag cut-off value. Description of cuttings from this interval does not show any coal. Thus the neutron log has not been edited at these depths. Instead, the spikes have been removed from the density curve used as input to the evaluation model. The coal flag curve is used as input when editing the RHOB curve for shoulder bed effects around the coal layers. The PetroWorks routine Coal_Edit is used when editing the RHOB curve, and the resulting output curve is pef_RHOBC. This curve is used as input in the evaluation model.The HeidrunEval model in PetroWorks was used when performing the petrophysical evaluation of this well. All the default parameters used are listed in Table 4-7 in 0. The parameters that are set different than default are listed in Table 1-3. The processed input curves used in the HeidrunEval model and the resulting output curves are listed in Table 4-4 in 0. CPI plot is also presented in 0. Average values for some reservoir parameters for each zone in the well is given in Table 1-4. There is not complete log coverage in the re 1.3, thus dummy base of the formation is set at the base of the log when computing the average values.

This was the fourth well drilled on Heidrun Nord after the exploration well 6507/8-4. The primary objective of the well was to find oil filled sandstones in re 1.13-1.3. The well starts off with 12 1/4 section in segment and crosses into segment where it continues as 1/2 section. The planned logging program in the 12 1/4 hole section was LWD GR/RES/DEN/NEU. The same was planned for the 1/2 section. No additional WL logging was planned. The objective of the data acquisition was geological zonation and petrophysical evaluation. In addition the log data would provide fluid information. 2.2 Logging operations The logging jobs performed in this well is Baker ATK/ORD/CCN during drilling of both theDate Rev. no. 12 of 39 2.2.1 Logging job no. The first logging job was Baker ATK/ORD/CCN in the 12 1/4 section providing GR/RES/DEN/NEU logs (Table 2-1). No problems were reported during the logging operations. When dumping memory data, the data proved to be corrupted. This was probably due to jarring. The data available for this section is the real-time logs. For more information on the drilling operation, see the section report [ 2].

The second logging job was Baker ATK/ORD/CCN in the 1/2 section, providing GR/RES/DEN/NEU logs (Table 2-2). The real-time data was affected by decoding problems, drilling during down linking and logging while bit was off bottom (logging while reaming). However the memory data was successfully dumped from the tools. For details on the drilling operation, see section report [ 3].

Date Rev. no. 14 of 39 2.3 Petrophysical evaluation 2.3.1 Raw curves The logs presented from the 12 1/4 section is real-time logs. Consequently, the logs are full of gaps and are of low resolution. The density neutron separation is not always clear oil separation or gas separation, but often something in between. In addition the unusually low neutron values in coal layers, indicates that even the memory log might not be of good quality either. All the raw curves are listed in Table 4-2 in 2.3.2 Composite curves The composite curves used for input to the evaluation model are listed in Table 4-5 in 0. The of the logs from the two sections drilled in this well. 2.3.3 Processing The upper part of this well (mainly the 12 1/4 section) is drilled close to well E-3 BH. Because of the bad data quality in the upper part (real-time logs), no petrophysical processing is performed in this area for well E-3 CH. It can be assumed that the properties are very similar to E-3 BH. The processing is performed from the re formation in segment and down to TD. E-3 CH is horizontal well covering the stratigraphy in the east of segment (E-3 BH only covers the western part of segment 1). A coal flag curve is generated using default cut-off values for RHOB and NPHI. The coal flag curve is used as input when editing the RHOB curve for shoulder bed effects around the coal layers. The PetroWorks routine Coal_Edit is used when editing the RHOB curve, and the resulting output curve is pef_RHOBC. The HeidrunEval model in PetroWorks was uses when performing the petrophysical evaluation of this well. All the default parameters used are listed in Table 4-7 in 0. The parameters that are set different than default are listed in Table 2-3. Because of the poor quality of the neutron log (gas zones and coal layers), the VSH is calculated using the GR curve. No mud KCl content is registered for the reservoir section of this well. Consequently default mud filtrate Cl- concentration and potassium ratio is used for salinity calculations in the evaluation. The lack of accurate salinity correction on the neutron log results in an inaccurate VSHDN calculation. Because of this, the GR curve has not been normalized and VSH is set equal toDate Rev. no. 15 of 39 VSHGR. Since the GR curve is not normalized, the GRmax value is changed from default to 125 API. listed in Table 4-5 in 0.

It was the fifth well to be drilled in the Heidrun Nord after exploration well 6507/8-4. The well was drilled as an 1/2 side track from well E-3 CH, kicked off below the 5/8 casing shoe. The primary objective of the well was to find oil filled sandstones in re 1.12-1.7. The planned logging program was LWD GR/RES/DEN/NEU. No additional WL logging was planned. The objective of the data acquisition was geological zonation and petrophysical evaluation. In addition the log data would provide fluid information. 3.2 Logging operations The logging job performed in this well is Baker ATK/ORD/CCN during drilling ( 3.2.1).Date Rev. no. 18 of 39 3.2.1 Logging job no. The logging job performed in well E-3 DH was Baker ATK/ORD/CCN providing GR/RES/DEN/NEU data (Table 3-1). Pulsing problems with the AutoTrak in the first BHA were observed soon after drilling out the cement in the 5/8 casing. Pump flow rate had to be increased to keep the tool pulsing, and it eventually stopped functioning at 2913 MD. There appears to have been problems with the power supply. The BHA was pulled out of hole and changed. The second AutoTrak functioned without problems. For more information on the drilling operation, see the section report [ 4]. Table 3-1 Logging job no.

From the previously drilled well E-3 CH, it was experienced that the density neutron separation did not clearly indicate gas or oil at all timed. Thus, there is an uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the logs. Baker LWD logs are regarded as medium quality logs. In well E-3 DH the neutron values over coal layers are unrealistically high. All the raw curves are listed in Table 4-3 in 0. 3.3.2 Composite curves The composite curves used for input to the evaluation model are listed in Table 4-6 in 0. The choice of raw curves is given as remark in the same table. 3.3.3 Processing At 3140 MD (re 1.7), there seems to be coal layer, but the density is not lower than the default density cut-off value. Coal is seen in the cuttings from this depth. To ensure that this coal layer is picked up by the Coal_Flag routine, the density cut-off values is increased in the re formation. The HeidrunEval model in PetroWorks was used when performing the petrophysical evaluation of this well. All the default parameters used are listed in Table 4-7 in 0. The parameters that are set different than default are listed in Table 3-2. Because of uncertainties regarding the neutron porosity log from the Baker CCN tool (ref. Well E-3 CH), the VSH is calculated using the GR curve. The GR curve us not normalized, but GRmin and GRmax is set according to the log readings in good sand and in pure shale. No mud KCl content is registered for well E-3 DH. Consequently default mud filtrate Cl- concentration and potassium ratio is used when estimating mud salinity in the evaluation model.Date Rev. no. 20 of 39 The processed input curves used in the HeidrunEval model and the resulting output curves are listed in Table 4-6 in 0.
