November 1988During the project, the following positioning systems were used: Southern North Sea Pulse/8 Chain Global Positioning System (Naystar) Satellites U.S. Navy Navigation Satellite System Transit. To allow the positioning of the rig on location, the Pulse/8 and G.P.S. receivers were interfaced to the Racal Survey G.N.S. computer system. This system is based on the H.P. 310 computer using on line software written by Racal Survey. The software allows the positioning data to be displayed on colour V.D.U. and plotter and also allows the data to be logged on printer or magnetic medium (e.g. disk/tape). The weather conditions during anchor handling and rig positioning were good.2. CO-ORDINATE AND POSITIONING SUM, CHAIN DATA The intended location for the Dyvi Stena at well 2/8-12 was given to Racal Survey Norge A/S by Amoco Norway Oil Company.This was as follows: INTENDED LOCATION GEOGRAPHICAL U.T.M. Latitude: 56 23' Easting : 527 Longitude: 3 26' Northing: 250 The co-ordinates are in terms of U.T.M. Zone 31, C.M. 3east, on European Datum 1950 (ref. appendix no. 7). 2.2 Southern North Sea Pulse/8 chain data The primary positioning system for the positioning of the Dyvi Stena at well location 2/8-12 was the Southern North Sea Pulse/8 chain operated by Racal Survey U.K. Ltd. The following stations are available on the chain: CODE STATION EASTING NORTHING 1. ST. Fergus 212 389 2. Utsira 606 575 3. Rome 853 117 4. Rrummhorn 768 935 5. Happisburgh 400 855 The co-ordinates are in terms of U.T.M. Zone 31, C.M. 3 East on European datum 1950 (ref. Appendix No. 7).OtMai Upon completion of the anchor tension test, logging of Pulse/8 data for the final position fix computation was started. During the period 0830 hours to 0930 hours on 07. November 1988, Pulse/8 readings were logged at an interval of seconds. The geometry of the logged patterns at the intended location is as follows: TANGENT APPLIED PATTERN DIRECTION (C-0) (deg.) VALUE o 334 1-2 +.11 o 038 1-3 o 066 1-4 o 023 1-5 The above C-0 values were supplied by Racal Survey (U.K.) Ltd. On completion of the logging, the raw pattern readings were listed and any erroneous data edited. statistical summary of the readings is as follows: PATTERN NUMBER OF MEAN STANDARD NUMBER OF ACCEPTED VALUE DEVIATION REJECTED READINGS (metres) (metres) READINGS 1-2 590 11 1-3 590 38 1-4 590 50 1-5 590 25CE10001 The mean values on the previous page were used in an off-line least squares solution on the G.N.S. computer system along with the antenna offset given in appendix no. to derive the following position: Latitude : 56 23' Easting: 527 Longitude: 03 26' Northing: 250 The co-ordinates are in terms of east, on European Datum 1950. (ref. U.T.M. Zone Appendix No. 31, 7). C.M. 3 The Pulse/8 position is on from the intended location. bearing of 013.0 (true)3.2 Accuracy considerations The Pulse/8 position was derived, from least squares adjustment which has the following statistical summary: PATTERN WEIGHT RESIDUAL 1-2 1-3 1-4 1-5 R.M.S. value: Mean Weight Residual: in Note: 1. Plots of the stability of the Pulse/8 can be seen in Appendix No. 2. 2. The above weights are derived from the reciprocal of the pattern lane widths at the final location. The theoretical 68% error ellipse for Pulse/8 position fix at the final location is shown over the page, along with the lines of position (L.O.P.) of the final pattern readings. Racal Survey Norge A/S quote an accuracy of better than 30 for Pulse/8 using the published C-0 values. The figures above indicate that better than this quoted accuracy was achieved.DOSCEI Diagram No. Theoretical 68 % error ellipse for Pulse/8 position fix at the final location. t 171 t t . i .... / ) ../ '..,. / ...__ ....... . / ; / ,- \..-' \ ...4 ./ 41- : -;f' ..,... .,-, 4/ ,t - 74 A Ii ' . / \ ..4'''' / 1 ' .  -4-4-, 4-7).j II t , i .........., ... , . . . / . 4. ). .- - .... . ,. .....- . : .... : ... . ...- . i.

POSITION FIX COMPUTATION 4.1 Observations and computational technique During the positioning of the Dyvi Stena at well location 2/8-12 G.P.S. w;as used. Once the rig was on location, data was logged using the G.N.S. computer system and was reprocessed upon return to the office. The re-processing took the form of listing the data and removing any erroneous values. Upon completion of this editing, the following data set was available for the final fix computation: DATA SET Date: 08. November 1988 Time (G.M.T.): 0049 hrs to 0117 hrs Height: 79 No samples: 301Racal Survey Name A/S 0'4.2 Datum transformations The positions output by the Trimble 4000A G.P.S. satellite receiver refer to the satellite geodetic datum which is W.G.S. 84. As the final G.P.S. position for the rig is required in E.D.-1950, set of transformation parameters must be applied to convert from W.G.S. 84 to E.D.-1950. This is carried out in the three stages listed below: 4.2.1 TRANSFORMATION FROM W.G.S. 84 TO W.G.S. 72 Translation in -4.5 Rotation about axis Scale change ppm 4.2.2 TRANSFORMATION FROM W.G.S. 72 TO TRANSIT SATELLITE PRECISE EPHEMERIS DATUM (NSWC 9Z-2). Scale change +0.862 ppm 4.2.3 TRANSIT SATELLITE PRECISE EPHEMERIS DATUM (NSWC 9Z-2) TO E.D.-l950 Translation in +89.5 Translation in +93.8 in Translation in +127.6 Rotation .about axis +0.974.3 Results and reduction to derrick centre The final G.P.S. position for the Trimble 4000A antenna on the Dyvi Stena was derived by meaning the observed positions presented in section 4.1. This is as follows: TRIMBLE 4000A ANTENNA (W.G.S.84). Latitude: 56 23' Longitude: 03 26' Ellipsoidal Height: Utilizing the datum transformations given in section 4.2, the following position corrections were used to transform the co-ordinates of the Trimble 4000A antenna from W.G.S. 84, to E.D.-1950: Diff. Latitude: Diff. Longitude: Diff. Height: + -39.78 Therefore the E.D.-1950 co-ordinates are as follows: TRIMBLE 4000A ANTENNA (E.D.-1950) Latitude: 56 23' Easting: 526 Longitude:03 26' Northing: 250 The offset between the Trimble antenna and the derrick centre is given in Appendix No. 5. When this is combined with the rig heading of 333.0 (true),  (grid) the following positional offsets were computed: Diff. Latitude: Diff. Easting: Diff. Longitude: +1.43 Diff. Northing: +24.5 inMarl Therefore, the final position is: DYVI STENA DERRICK CENTRE GEOGRAPHICAL- U.T.M.. Latitude: 56 23' Easting: 527 Longitude: 03 26' Northing: 250 m. east, on European Datum 1950 (ref. Appendix No. 7). This position is metres on bearing of 00.2 (true) from the intended position.5. TRANSIT SATELLITE POSITION FIX COMPUTATION 5.1 Observations and computational technique The final position of the Dyvi Stena at well location 2/8-12 was derived using data logged and computed in the field from transit satellites. The Transit satellite data logging onboard Dyvi Stena began after the anchor tension test had been completed at 0740 hours on 07. November 1988 and continued to 1630 hours 08. November 1988. During this time 22 three dimensional passes were accepted by the JMR-4 Transit satellite receiver. 5.2 Datum transformation The computation of the recorded satellite data was carried out on the Transit satellite broadcast ephemeris datum and the single point position derived therefore refers to this datum. As the final co-ordinates for the rig are required in E.D.-1950 transformation must be applied to convert the final position for the rig from the Transit satellite broadcast ephemeris datum to E.D.-1950. The parameters used were those recommended during meeting of the National Survey Organisations with concessionary interests in the North Sea (ref. Ordnance Survey Professional Paper No. 30). These are applicable to the European Continental Shelf north of latitude 47 and to the North Sea south of 64 N, and are as follows: + 83 +110 +118Note: The above parameters are to convert from Cartesian co-ordinates on TRANSIT-B.E. datum to Cartesian co-ordinates E.D.-1950. To convert' from E.D.-1950 to TRANSIT-B.!., the mathematical sign of all the parameters must be reversed. 5.3 Results On completion of the processing, the following co-ordinates were obtained for the JMR-4 antenna on the rig: JMR -4 ANTENNA POSITION (TRANSIT-B.!.) Latitiude: 56 23' Utilizing the datum transformation parameters given in section 5.2 the following position corrections were used to transform the co-ordinates of the rig antenna from TRANSIT-B.!. to - JMR-4 ANTENNA POSITION GEOGRAPHICAL U.T.M. The co-ordinates are in terms of U.T.M. : Zone 31, C.M. 3east, on European Datum 1950. (ref. Appendix No. 7).5.4 Reduction to derrick centre, well 2/8-12 The offset between the JMR-4 antenna and the derrick centre is given in Appendix No. 5. When this is combined with the rig heading of 333.0 (true), 332.6 (grid) the following Diff. Latitude: Diff. Easting: +21.8 Diff. Longitude: +1.28 Diff. Northing: DYVi STENA DERRICK CENTRE Latitude: 56 23' 48.78N Easting: 527 Longitude:03 26' 15.57E Northing: 250 The co-ordinates are in terms of U.T.M. Zone 31, C.M. This position is metres on bearing of 028.7 (true) The geoidal height at well location 2/8-12 was computed as follows: Antenna height above ellipsoid: Antenna height above sea level: Geoidal height (E.D.-1950): The geoidal height is also shown diagramaticallY in Appendix No. 4.5.5 Accuracy considerations On completion of the processing the standard deviations for the three dimensional solution were as follows: S.D. latitude: S.D. longitude: S.D. height: Based on 22 passes Under ideal conditions with Transit satellite receiver located on land, accuracy of Transit satellite single point position should be around to 10 metres. However due to the noiser data observed on the rig and' additional errors due to the datum transformation between the Transit, satellite broadcast ephemeris datum and European Datum 1950 we would estimate the horizontal accuracy of the JMR-4 antenna position on the rig to be better than +/- 12 in. In addition to the above error, an error of up to +/- metres could exist due to the offset between the JMR-4 antenna and the rig's derrick centre. Due to this we would estimate that the absolute accuracy for the Dyvi Stena derrick centre is +/- metres. Bergen, 5. December 1988 RACAL SURVEY NORGE A/S -1.4 464 ,. John A. Vint Staff/Q.C.
