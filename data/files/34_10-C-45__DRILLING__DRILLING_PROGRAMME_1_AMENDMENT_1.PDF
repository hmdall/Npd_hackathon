As result of this, well C-45 will be cored and logged from the bottom of Lista Formation and into the Shetland Group. The cores will be studied to get more understanding of the Shetland-problems seen on Gullfaks. core will also be cut for UBO-project. The cores will be investigated and studied. rock mechanics study will be performed regarding underbalanced drilling. This programme will replace the operations described in the 12 1/4 section in the Drilling Programme for Well 34/10-C-45 (doc # GF RESU U-02 00029). The operations covered in this programme is cleanup of 13 3/8 casing, 12 1/4 drilling, 1/2 coring, 1/2 drilling, open hole logging, hole opening from 1/2 to 12 1/4, running 5/8 liner and cementing. 1.1 Status of the well The 17 1/2 hole was drilled to 2483 mMD / 1714,2 mTVD and 13 3/8 casing installed at 2478 mMD / 1711 mTVD.

The drill string consist of 1/2 DP.  Remember to install totco ring above the 12 1/8 stab.  All components in the string must be drifted to minimum 3/4.  Rack back the BHA. Almost the same BHA will be used for hole opening. Bit  Used rock bit, Hughes Christensen ATJG8  TFA = 1,04 in2. Operational parameters Recommended pump rate: depended of LOT. 300 lpm gives an ECD of 1,80 sg at the shoe. Recommended RPM: 100-130 RPM Recommended WOB: 1-5 tons LOT  Perform the LOT with 150 lpm.  Minimum acceptable value is 1, 82 sg. Gyro  The DP gyro will be run after taking the LOT. Position bit inside 13 3/8 casing when running the gyro.  It is possible to pump the gyro down.  The gyro will be run using Schlumberger supplied WL unit and Scientific circulating head..  The hole will be drilled to approximately 1720 mTVD after running the gyro. As the gyro can move the casing point up or down, the length of the section drilled is uncertain.  Keep attention to the CCL to assure depth control.  Tie-in for the Gyro is at wellhead: MD [m] Inc Azi TVD [m] [m] [m] Risks  Drift the pipe to minimum 3/4.  During the initialization process the drill pipe must be kept as stationary as possible.  The survey engineer is responsible for communicating to the driller what pump strokes are required. If the pump rate is increased too much or too suddenly, there is risk of pumping the gyro off the end of the wireline.Mud  Displace to 1,76 sg mud when drilling the shoe track.  Threat the mud before pulling out of hole with the 12 1/4 BHA.  See drilling fluid programme in appendix for details. 2.3 Coring 1/2 1/2  Ref appendix for coring assembly  90 ft core barrel with jambuster system.  The drill string consist of 1/2 DP in cased hole and 5 DP in open hole.  The second core run will include GR/RES sub on top of the core assembly. The GR/RES results will decide the length of the third run. The GR/RES sub will only sample in memory.  Pumprate for the GR/RES sub: max 3030 lpm.  UBO project need 4 core for rock mechanics study. The third core run will be without the jambuster system. This will give 27 ft 4 core, which is sufficient for the tests in the core lab. Minimum length of the 4 core is m. The finial length will be decided after analyzing the GR/RES data.  The length and number of runs depend on the cores ability to jam. At least 20 from top Shetland must be cored.  All barrels are gel filled. In case of trip without filling the core barrel, use big bags / empty barrels to remove the gel. Note that the coring assembly is very stabilized assembly and will not create any DLS. As this well was planned, the cored interval was planned as DLS drop. As part of the section is cored, the wellpath is redesigned. See appendix for details of the wellpath.  Use low ROP and controlled parameters in order to avoid jamming of the cores.  Recommended parameters (typical for coring): -Pump rate through the core assembly: 1000  1400 lpm -RPM on the drill string: 80-130 RPM -WOB: 4-12tons  The core bit will be heavy set.  Due to low permeability cores, the pulling speed with the cores will be reduced. TD -> 800 m: normal pulling speed 800 -> 400 m: min / stand 400 -> 100 m: min / stand 100 -> surface: 12 min / stand. Ref appendix 1, drilling fluid programme.  Condition the mud before pulling out of hole with 12 1/4 assembly.  Originally, this section was planned using oil based drilling fluid. Due to the possibility of high mud weight, water based drilling fluid will be used to increase the operational window and reduce the possibility of lot circulation.  The spec for API fluid loss is 2-3 ml. Handling of cores  To avoid drying out the cores, all cores must be covered in oil  Ensure smoothly handling of the cores. Shock log container will be used.  Core hand is responsible for handling of the cores to the core lab. Contingency: coring If problems with coring, 1/2 hole will be drilled to top of the Shetland Group. RAB (resistivity at bit) will be used to avoid drilling into the Shetland group, as the top of the Shetland Group is where the most important core is. Contingency: high pressure in Shetland If high pressure is experienced in the Shetland Group, the well will be killed with required kill mud. If the required mud weight is to high for further drilling, the hole will be plugged back with cement. The maximum mud weight for further coring is 0,06 sg below LOT. Evaluate further drilling / coring Contingency: plugging If the required mud weight is to high for further coring and drilling, the open hole will be plugged back. cement plug will be se from TD of the well and 100 inside 13 3/8 casing. This plug will be pressure tested. As plug number 2, EZSV plug will be set above the cement plug. The volume needed for pressure testing the plug must be less than for pressure testing the cement plug, hence the depth of the plug will be approximately 1800 mMD. The EZSV plug will be set as bridge plug and will be pressure tested from above.  Be aware of the possibility of gas in the core barrels.  Handling of cores and cooperation with the crane operator.  Be aware of the risk of H2S if the core is cut in an area with injected water. Measure H2S amount when opening the core barrel.  Chalk stringers are expected. Reduce RPM and increase WOB to avoid spinning and whirl.Amendment to drilling programme Well 34/10-C-45 12 1/4 section GFRESU U-02 00066 2002-11-27 2.4 Drilling 1/2 hole to TD  Ref appendix for assembly.  The drill string consists of 1/2 DP in cased hole and 5 DP in open hole.  The bend on the motor is set to 1,5 deg. This high bend will be limiting factor regarding string RPM.  The LWD tool will include GR/RES/DEN/NEU.  ECD sub will be used.  Rock bit will be used Operating parameters Pump rate for motor: 1140 2270 LPM Pump rate for MWD: 1140  2270 LPM String RPM: max 140 RPM in hold section / 50 RPM in curved section. WOB: 5-10 tons Recommended pump rate for drilling: 2000 lpm. This gives an ECD of 1,82 sg at the bit with 1,76 sg MW. Note: condition the mud before pulling out of hole. 2.5 Logging 1/2 hole (TLC)  See appendix for tool string.  Logging sensors: FMI / MDT dual packer / DSI (sonic)  Option: Fluid sample.  Option: logging using open hole tractor  run is expected.  During MDT pressure points, the drill sting must not be moved.  Maximum running logging speed for DSI (x dipole) is 300 m/hr.  TLC: Perform sticky test (5 minutes more than connection time) before taking pressure points.Doc. no. Date Rev. no. 10 of 29 2.6 Hole opening from 1/2 to 12 1/4  The 12 1/4 hole opener assembly will almost be the same as the 12 1/4 drilling and cleanup assembly, but the lowermost stabilizer is taken out. .  The hole opener will be run on rotary assembly.  Pump rate for the MWD (ECD sub): 2271  4542 lpm. Recommended pumprate: 3000  3500 lpm Recommended RPM on the drill string: 120-170 RPM Maximum WOB: 10 tons Operations  Use slow rotation and low WOB when tagging the shoulder of the predrilled 1/2 hole to ensure that the bull nose and the stabilizer have entered the pilot hole. This should also be checked against the tagging depth of the previous BHA.  When shoulder is confirmed, continue to increase the RPM to about 120-170 RPM  After opening the hole to TD, pump BU with maximum pumprate and RPM.  Pay close attention to the ECD values from the ECD sub.  The hole opener has backreaming cutters. If backreaming, do not stand still when rotating.  Take torque readings with 10/20 RPM and up down weights at TD and at casing shoe.  Running string for 5/8 liner must be drifted to 3.  To avoid loosing the XO and bullnose in hole this will be bakerlocked to the hole opener.  hole opener is more aggressive than bit and it is therefore necessary to control the WOB.  Follow up the ECD values.  Use data from the pilot hole as roadmap. 2.7 5/8 liner Preparation All preparations for the liner job should be in accordance with Local Best Practice for Gullfaks Drilling and the offshore check lists/detailed simulation for the job. Special attention should be paid to the following:  Check the liner ID and calculate the equivalent liner diameter for estimating the correct capacity for the cement job.Date Rev. no. 11 of 29  The mudlogger must check the proposed running speed for the liner based on actual mud parameters, observed ECD, obtained FIT value and results from pressure logging.  MU the cementing head and rack back in the derrick.  Adjust the gripper head on the Eagle before start running the liner.  Minimize the use of pipe dope in the running string to avoid problems with dropping the ball to set the hanger.  The liner will be set in the lower part of the Shetland Group.  The liner running string consist of 57 5/8 HWDP and 1/2 DP to surface. Running 5/8 liner The running procedure below applies for two-plug system. This means that the ball seat is installed in the landing collar.  Casing dope: OCR 325 AG.  Liner hanger type: Rotating  Required weight to set liner top packer: minimum 20 tons -first, apply 20 tons on top of packer without rotating. -apply 20 tons with rotating 10 RPM afterwards. This is according to Weatherford procedure.  Bakerlock the shoe joint, intermediate joint and the float/landing collar joint. Check for flow through.  Fill every joint when running in hole until the string is not floating  Fill every 5th joint thereafter.  RIH according to tally, install the hanger/hanger running tool. Fill the PBR with high viscous mud.  Circulate one liner volume.  RIH with the running string and DP. Fill every 5th stand.  Break circulation carefully every 500 m, except in the interval 200 above to 100 below the 13 3/8 casing shoe. Circulate the liner down the last stand.  Install the cement head.  Tag bottom and pull up m.  Break circulation carefully and increase the pump rate in increments until max. pump rate. Circulate BU. If an increase in pump pressure or tendencies to pack-off the hole is observed, decrease the pump rate until the parameters have normalized.  Set the hanger  Establish circulation and rotation of the liner. Increase the pump rate in steps to max. pump rate according to the cement job simulations. Circulate the hole clean.  Attempt to rotate the liner immediately after the hanger is set. Calculate max surface torque based on free rotational torque and make-up torque for the 5/8 liner. Recommended RPM is 20-30.Date Rev. no. 12 of 29 2.8 Cementing 5/8 liner Job assumptions:  pre job meeting with all involved personnel shall be held. The OPTICEM calculations and diagrams must be discussed and understood.  Approx. m3 base oil will be pumped in front of 20 m3 1,83 sg Tuned Spacer.  The 5/8 liner will be cemented to the top of the hanger using 1,90 SG gas tight lead slurry (approximately 10 m3 cement).  Rotate the string while conditioning the mud and pumping cement.  After the liner has been hung off, the pump rate must be increased slowly and stepwise. The pump pressure must be stabilized or decreasing before increasing the rate. The mud parameters must be optimized prior to starting the cement job.  Circulate until mud weight in equals mud weight out or minimum times BU. Ref. to OPTICEM for details for mud conditioning.  At least two full circulations shall be made with rate equal to the minimum rate planned for the cement displacement.  Gas readings shall be below 3%.  Excess mixing fluid must be re-injected, and the composition and volumes recorded on ESOP.  If pressure points have been taken in the reservoir, use this information to estimate the probable fracture gradient. This will optimize the circulation rates during the cement job.  Due to low fracture limitations, the liner may be cemented with foam cement.Date Rev. no. 13 of 29 Cementing of 5/8 liner: Ref. Halliburton OPTICEM for pumping schedule during the cement job.  Establish rotation after the hanger is set.  Start mixing the cement slurry so that the cement is ready to be pumped immediately after the spacer has been pumped in the hole.  The slurry will be batch mixed.  Pump base oil and Tuned Spacer using the rig pumps.  Drop the dart.  Displace the cement to the rig floor.  Displace the cement with mud using the rig pumps.  If there is positive indication of dart release, bump the plug with 1000 lpm and 70 bar above FCP. Test the integrity of the plug and the liner for min.  Confirm setting of the packer by pressure testing the packer to 180 bar / min.  After the packer is set and RT is released, circulate out excess cement the long way.  Circulate the long way with max. flow rate to clean out the running string.Date Rev. no. 14 of 29 3 Appendix 1, Attachments 1. BHA for cleanup and drilling 12 1/4 hole 2. BHA for 1/2 hole 3.
