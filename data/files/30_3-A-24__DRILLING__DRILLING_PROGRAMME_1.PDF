The uncertainty for the pressure in Ness has been increased to +/- 20 bar and the reservoir pressure for Ness is now estimated to 280 bar +/- 20 bar and IDS to 330 +/- 20 bar, ref chapter 4.4.2 and Appendix A.6 Pressure Prediction Plot.  The coring interval in IDS has been extended to 54m MD  An RST Sigma base log has been included in the completion phase before perforation.15 of 104 3 Health, safety, environment and quality (HSE & Q) 3.1 HSE For this well, the special HSE focus points should be:  Minimize crane operations. The timing of equipment ship-out is important to achieve this. Also good deck management and planning ahead will be important key factors.  No dropping objects.  All relevant personnel involved have to use radio with head set. Focus on correct communication. Received message must be confirmed.  Handling of 20 whipstock and 1/2 DC manually.  Safe handling of core barrels. Long cores will be cut in the IDS and the Statfjord Fm and the handling must be planned thoroughly in advance.  Correct and safe handling of radioactive sources. Relevant area(s) to be closed off with barriers. Barriers must be respected. 3.2 Quality For this well, special quality focus points will be:  Active use of 15 Mutes plan. Plan ahead and include parallel activities to optimise progress. Even though the well-path is not the most challenging drilled at Veslefrikk, it is very important to keep focus on the operation to achieve good result. Do it right the first time. This plan represents technical limit.  Establish window in 20 casing with no obstructions.  The whole well drilled with conventional motor according to plan.  No un-scheduled trips neither in 17 1/2, 12 1/4 nor 'A section.  Coring in IDS and in the Statfjord Fm with maximum recovery.  No stuck pipe (tool/cable) during logging, especially the mini DST.  Zone isolation through the reservoir. 3.2.1 QRS QRS has to be filled out from all sections for all service companies. Be aware of the new QRS forms when completing Quality Rating Sheet (QRS)  checklist is in the ESOP database VFR B&B.Date Rev. no. 16 of 104 3.3 Risk analysis All risks that may affect the project are identified and grouped into different levels. Selected solutions are mainly based on excluding high-level risks. The risk potential in the chosen solutions has further been reduced by use of contingency plans. Relevant contingency plans are discussed in the Section Guidelines. 3.3.1 Potential for well interference Interference wells Depth inCentre A-16A Well (m) / centre distance (m) Mm. Allowed Distance (m) Statoil Closing Factor These figures are based on the uncertainty error models RIGS continuous in the 13 3/8 casing in well 8S which will be used as tie on. The RIGS survey in is updated to the new error model. The A-10 BT2 well is close to A-24 in the reservoir section. The shortest distance is below permanent plug in the lower part of A-10 BT2. The plug in the A-10 BT2 well stands 345 bar differential pressure from below. Ref. Appendix B.3 Clearence Listing. 3.3.2 Stuck pipe There will be risk of differential stuck pipe during drilling of 1/2 section due to high overbalance. Continuous focus on this issue during operation, together with good drilling practice, will help preventing stuck pipe. With reference to field experiences the risk of getting stuck with logging tool/cable is even higher. Before starting the reservoir logging meeting with relevant personnel will be held to highlight the risk, and also the criteria for completing the logging program if sticking tendencies are seen will be discussed. Stuck pipe is always potential risk in all sections. Continuous focus on hole cleaning and hole condition is very important also in the 17 1/2 and 12 1/4 sections. Refer to Veslefrikk Best Practice on hole cleaning.

The geological prognosis below the Base Cretaceous Unconformity is based on isochores above and below Drake 1, which is depth converted from the seismic data. The Base Cretaceous Unconformity is depth converted. Due to velocity anomaly in the nearest well 30/3-A-3 R, the uncertainty in the depth conversion is larger than normal on the Veslefrikk Horst. Seismic uncertainties: Base Cretaceous Unconformity: +/- 10 mTVD. Seismic uncertainty Drake 1: +/- 20 mTVD. Isochore uncertainty: +/- TVT (True vertical thickness) 4.3.3 Total Depth TD is planned 75 MD below the OWC in the Statfiord Formation to have enough space to log the entire hydrocarbon-bearing interval in future saturation monitoring operations. 4.3.4 OWC, Fluid Gradients and Pressures Formation/Area OWC TVD MSL Datum Depth TNT) MSL Pressure Datum Depth Oil gradient (bar/m) Water gradient (bar/m) Tarbert - Main Field 791 2770 324,0 Upper Ness (Ness 3) - Main Field 819 2770 324,0 Lower Ness/Etive/Rannoch/ Oseberg - Main Field 907 2800 321,2 Statfjord Gas/Oil Contact (GOC) 194 3200 Statfiord Oil/Water contact (OWC) 208 3200 355,0 4.4 Pressure Prognosis 4.4.1 Pore Pressure Above The Reservoir The Pressure Gradient Plot, see Appendix A.5, shows the prognosed gradients of pore pressure, formation strength and overburden in the well 30/3-A-24, relative to the 56 RKB elevation.22 of 104  The pore pressure gradient follows the normal seawater gradient from the window in the 20 casing at 700m MD to the base of the normally pressured rocks, at approximately 1500 m TVD. In the wells 30/3-A-1, A-3 and A-5 the base occurs at 1545 m, 1460 and 1470 m TVD, respectively.  The pore pressure gradient increases rapidly throughout the remaining part of the Hordaland Group. It is expected to reach maximum of g/cm3 at the transition to the Rogaland Group, at approximately 1954 TVD.  The gradient decreases through the Rogaland Group and uppermost Shetland Group to approximately 1,31 g/cm3 at 2400 TVD.  From this depth on gradual increase in pore pressure gradient is expected, to 1,38 g/cm3 at approximately 2650 TVD.  rapid decrease in pore pressure gradient is expected through the lowermost Shetland Group and the Viking Group. The pore pressure at the base of the Viking Group is assumed to equal the Upper Brent Group regime initial pressure, and is calculated to 1,17 g/cm3 equivalent mud weight. 4.4.2 Reservoir Pressure The reservoir pressure prognosis is primarily based on observed pressures in A-3, A-4A, A-5A and A-20A. These three wells are located near the A-24 location, and it is assumed that there is good pressure communication in this area. Pressure support to the IDS production in A-24 will be provided primarily by A-20A in the southwest and only insignificantly by A-17A in the northwest. The A-24 well will be placed within an area with good reservoir properties in the IDS formation. A-20A is located at the boundary of this good area, but as PLT logging of A-5A indicated good pressure communication between A-5A and A-20A, it is likely that also A-24 will receive sufficient pressure support from A-20A. Consequently, increasing or decreasing the A-20A injection rate can influence the IDS reservoir pressure. Between A-17A in the northwest and A-24 there is an area with permeability in the range of only few mDarcy in the IDS formation. The IDS pressure in the segment is currently high, and the A-24 location could be slightly affected by this, but due to the poor area between the A- and D-segment, the A-24 well will be mainly influenced by A-20A. Pressure support to the Oseberg and Etive production in A-24 will be provided primarily by A-21 in the south, but also from A-11 (Etive and Ness) over the arcuate fault, and from A-15 and A-6A in the north. Reconverting A-17A to an injector and starting Oseberg injection as planned will give the necessary pressure support to Oseberg 1, which is generally depleted elsewhere on the field. This will not be performed before the A-24 well has been drilled, so in the prognosis the Oseberg pressure is relatively low. Ness channel sand is present in the existing A-3 well, but it is uncertain how far east this channel belt is stretching. If Ness sand is present in A-24 it will probably have efficient pressure support from the planned annulus injection in A-20A. Since the A-20A recompletion,23 of 104 which is required to start annulus injection, is postponed until just before the A-24 drilling starts the reservoir pressure will be moderate. The distribution of the Ness channel sands remains uncertain until the new seismic data has been collected and interpreted. If the A-24 location contains Ness sand, the reservoir pressure is highly dependant on which channel system it is part of. Formation Reservoir Pressure 01.01.2002 Tarbert 290 +/- 20 bar Ness Fm.

The pressure prognosis will be updated prior to start drilling of the 12 1/4 section. For details see Pressure Gradient Plot 30/3-A-24 Appendix A.6. 4.4.3 Hole Stability 4.4.3.1 Fracture Gradients The fracture gradient above the reservoir is based on FIT/LOT tests in near by wells. The gradient through the reservoir is calculated based on mini fracture tests. It is assumed that there is relation between reduction in pore pressure (depletion) and reduction in fracture pressure (0,667 bar reduction per bar depletion).24 of 104 4.4.3.2 Collapse Collapse calculations have been performed by the aid of Stabil spreadsheet. The values are compared with the experience gained from the 24 wells drilled from the template and two exploration wells on the structure.  The lower part of the Hordaland and the Rogaland Group come up with high collapse values. The TD of the 17 1/2 section is therefore planned at 1600 TVD in the Hordaland Group, and the 13 3/8 casing will be run in hole immediately after drilling. mud weight of g/cm3 should be sufficient to ensure stable conditions.  Stable well conditions will be obtained using mud weight of 1,55 g/cm3 or higher while drilling the remaining part of the Hordaland, Rogaland and Shetland Groups.  The Draupne Formation, near TD for the 12 1/4 section, is known to cause unstable hole conditions, especially when left exposed for longer time periods. The formation will be drilled with high mud weight and the short time interval between drilling the formation and running the 5/8 casing through the formation, will ensure stable hole conditions. 4.4.4 Safety Aspects The mud weight will be reduced from 1,55 g/cm3 in the 12 1/4 section, to 1,25 g/cm3 in the 1/2 section. Thus, the 12 1/4 rat hole will first be exposed to high pressure and then to low pressure. This may cause instability and the length of the rat hole should be kept at minimum in order to reduce the length of the possibly collapsing interval. The reservoir pressure prediction is most uncertain, especially for Ness Fm., ref Ch. 4.4.2. Furthermore, it is not even certain that Ness will be present in the well at all. However, if it is present and pressure close to the minimum case occurs, i.e. 225  20 bar, the overbalance will be in the order of 145 bars with mud weight of g/cm3. The overbalance might be as high as 90 bar and 95 bar with maximum predicted drawdown in the Ness Fm and the Oseberg Fm respectively and 118 bar in the Statfjord Fm. The overbalance through the rest of the Brent Group will be around 70 bars and 65 bars through IDS (with maximum draw down). Be aware of the possibility of differential sticking. Caliper logs in some of the recent wells have shown that coal beds and carbonaceous shale in the Ness Formation may cause over gauge holes. Be aware of tight hole and risk of packing off the drill string while running in or pulling out of hole through the Ness Formation. 4.4.5 Temperature The estimated formation temperature is based on logs and drill stem tests in nearby well. The temperature is expected to reach 125 - 130C in the reservoir.Date Rev. no. 25 of 104 4.5 Geological sampling and formation evaluation 4.5.1 Mud logging Ref Main Drilling Programme Veslefrikk A. 4.5.2 Cuttings and Mud Sampling The well is classified as NONE key well for sampling (ref. Main Drilling Programme Veslefrikk A). No sampling is required while drilling the 17 1/2 and 12 'A section (the Nordland, Hordaland, Rogaland, Shetland and Viking Groups), other than spot samples in order to produce formation evaluation log, i.e. spot sample interval of approximately 10m TVD. Sample intervals in the 'A section (reservoir) will be as follows: Wet samples: All potential reservoir intervals sets (3 intervals) Remaining parts such as the Heather Fm., the Drake Fm. and Burton/Amundsen Fm. 2 sets (10 intervals) Dry samples: All potential reservoir intervals set (3 intervals) 1 set (10 intervals) 4.5.3 Coring Coring is planned in the IDS (54 MD) and in the Statfjord Formation (40 TVD). The core in IDS is planned to start 20 MD below top IDS3 and must include 12 of IDS2 where an MDT test is planned. This is to get good petrophysical and sedimentological evaluation of the tested interval. Coring in the Statfjord Formation shall include the Statfjord- Amundsen boundary. The coring is needed to improve the reservoir understanding of distribution of heterogeneities and the facies architecture. These are crucial factors for reservoir communication and sweep. All cores must be oriented. 4.5.4 Logging while drilling MWD-GR will be logged in the 17 'A section for stratigraphic and depth control.

Results from the openhole logging and new production and injection data from other wells will provide information for the choice of optimum production strategy. In order to balance the reservoir drainage points and limit the scaling potential, the preferred strategy is presently to perforate Etive 3, Ness and Tarbert first and then open the IDS formation. Oseberg is expected to be more or less flooded. Oseberg and will probably be the last Formation to be opened. 6.2 Cementation/zone isolation Good cementation/zone isolation is required between IDS and Oseberg, Oseberg and Etive, and Etive and Ness. Internal zone isolation in both the Oseberg and the Ness Fm. is required and shall be verified by cement bond log. 6.3 Pressure and Temperature Gauges A permanent pressure and temperature gauge shall be installed in the well as close to the reservoir as possible. 6.4 Other requirements 6.4.1 Gas liji The well will be equipped with gas lift equipment. 6.4.2 Completion configuration The well completion configuration will be monobore 6.4.3 Screens No screens are required.Veslefrikk Drilling Programme well 30/3-A-24 Doc. no.

The table illustrates the need for having well with wireline access, which gives 40 million NOK lower costs in the planned well intervention and data acquisition. 6.6 Expected Production rate and Duration 6.6.1 Expected rate The expected initial production oil rate from Etive, Ness and Tarbert is between 600 and 1100 Sm3/d with rapid decline due to rising water cut. The expected rate contribution from IDS is between 700 and 1200 Sm3/d initially, and from Oseberg it is between 200 and 300 Sm3/d. Estimated liquid rate and water cut development for V33 is illustrated in the figure below.43 of 104 Estimated liquid rate and watercut in the V33 well Max. liquid rate    Mn. liquid rate 0-Watercut 6.6.2 Expected duration The expected duration of the well is more than 10 years. 6.6.3 Zones/intervals 10 % 30 % 20 % Perforation of both IDS, Oseberg, Etive, Ness and Tarbert is planned, but not simultaneously. 6.7 Perforation method Perforation shall be performed on wireline. Before initial perforation Saturation base log (RST Sigma) should be run. 6.8 Rat hole requirements TD is planned 75 MD below the OWC in the Statfjord Formation to have enough space to log the entire hydrocarbon-bearing interval in future saturation monitoring operations.0 STATO 44 of 104 6.9 Sand protection potential Based on experience from other wells sand production can occur when the IDS start producing water. No sand protection equipment is planned installed. This might imply that sand production can restrict the production rate from the IDS in the well.45 of 104 7 Completion outline 7.1 Completion Layout The well will be completed as monobore well with 'A tubing and liner. See Appendix C.7 for Completion schematic. The completion operation is planned without any use of wireline, the production packer will be set against the seal stem in the liner top, the ASV system will be set with dedicated control line and dump valve is pre-installed in the shallowest side pocket mandrel. 7.2 Well Data (all depths and well path data are planned) Well no.: 30/3-A-24 Slot/shaft Well type Production Completion configuration 'A Producing reservoirs IDS, Oseberg, Etive and Ness (not simultaneously) Top liner hanger PBR 3240m MD Minimum ID in completion at depth 4,276 in 5-1/2 tubing at 3228 Type DHSV 'A TRSP-6-HO TD 4108 MD PBTD 4072 MD Maximum deviation at depth 51,4 deg @ 0 MD Deviation in reservoir 51,3 deg.
