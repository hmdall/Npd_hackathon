O. Box 1369/Vika Oslo Norway Dear Sir: 20. APR i970 April 14, 1970 Logs from Esso Exploration Norway 25/10-1 As requested in Mr. R. E. Anderson's letter (S-086/70) of April 1, 1970, we have reexamined the FDC log and the SP curve. We agree with your con- clusions on the scaling of the FDC log.. Also, we agree that the SP shift between 3900 ft. and 4090 ft. may be caused by formation changes rather than adjustment by the logging engineer. more detailed discussion of these points is contained in the attached memorandum by F. S. Millard. We appreciate your calling these matters to our attention, and your concern about good quality control on future logging operations. If we can be of assistance, please call on us.

MorganInterpretation of Logs From Esso Exploration Norway 25/10-1 In reply to request from Esso Exploration Norway Inc., well logs recorded in the Norway 25/10-1 well have been reexamined for quality and log scaling. Our log interpretation report, dated November 25, 1969, included section on log quality as follows: Log Quality Log quality is fair to poor for the well logs run in the 25/10-1 well. Several discrepancies were observed on the induction electric log which are the result of the logging engineer's ineptitude. The SP curve shale base line was improperly located on Run so that the SP curve went off scale to the left at 4090 ft where the base of thick sand was logged. Apparently the logging engineer noted this, and shifted the SP curve to the right so that the log would appear on the film. comparison of the SP shale base line above and below the sand indicates shift of to 10 millivolts which should have been noted on the log. better technique would have been to relog with proper SP shale base line setting. There is also depth discrepancy of ft between Runs and which adds repeat section of 4 ft from 4500 to 4504 ft on the composite log. The BHC sonic log was very noisy and cycle skipping was especially severe on Run 4. Cycle skipping can be caused by faulty surface or downhole instrumentation, improper operational technique, or possibly by gas in the mud. We suggest that the sonic log be rerun in the event the well is reentered. Excessive borehole rugosity and enlargement prevented the effective use of the microlaterolog and compensated formation density log for forma- tion evaluation. Therefore, data from these logs was not relied upon for calculating resistivity indexes. The possibility that the SP base line shift between 3900 ft and 4090 ft was the result of formation change rather than an SP shift made by the logging engineer has been considered. If the shale beds above and below the thick sand from 3955 ft to 4090 ft have interstital waters which are much different in their chemical composition, then there is possibility that an SP change could occur. There is some evidence to support this possibility since the shale above the sand has an average induction log resietivity of ohm-m, whereas the shale below the sand has an average resistivity of ohm-m. resistivity gradient is present from the base of the sand to about 5400 ft. Also, transit time gradient is noted on the sonic log. These gradients suggest the possibility of an abnormal formation pressure condition in which case the change in shale resistivity could be accounted for by the degree of compaction of the shale beds. rather than by change in the chemical composition of the interstital water.ft - - A review of the density log has been made and it is our opinion that it is properly scaled. Our original interpretation was made assuming standard bulk density scale of - - gm/cc. This assumption was made because the before and after calibration shows the mechanical zero to be at zero position on tract III. This is compatable for - - density scale. Since no mechanical zero shift was observed on the log at the pick up depth, we assumed that the scale had to be - - gm/cc rather than the 1.8 - - gm/cc scale shown on the log heading. Further study of the density log shows that the mechanical zero was shifted divisions or gm/cc to the right thus verifying the scale shown on the log heading. The mechanical zero shift of divisions was recorded at the conclusion of the log run and the mechanical zero is properly positioned at gm/cc. The density log readings reported on the log analysis report of November 25, 1969 are in error and should be corrected by gm/cc. This change in bulk density increases the calculated- porosity values causing them to be in reasonable agreement with porosity values calculated from the sonic log transit time. Since the density log measurements were not used in the calculations presented in our original memorandum on this well, no change is needed in the interpretations contained in the memorandum dated November 25, 1969.
