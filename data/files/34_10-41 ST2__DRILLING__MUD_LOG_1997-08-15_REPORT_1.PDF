This well was sidetracked from 2913mMD 2222mTVD on August 1997. Final TD was reached at 3420mMD 2584.8mTVD (drillers depth) on 14 August 1997. The well was plugged and abandoned. Objective The primary objective of well 34/10-41S is to prove oil in the Brent Group sands and as secondary in the Statfjord Formation sands on the A-prospect, situated south of the Tordis field. This well will be drilled deviated and at an optimal location to establish an oil- water contact. If commercial hydrocarbon accumulations are discovered, the well may be tested and permanently abandoned. Geoservices Mudlogging A standard North Sea Mudlogging unit running Geoservices ALS2 Level 4 software was used for this well. The unit was manned at all times by data engineer, with mudloggers present during the sampled intervals. Real time depth data was collected at lm intervals throughout the well. Additionally, the entire time database for the well (4 second storage interval) was backed up to magnetic tape and is available for analysis. Other functions performed by Geoservices included hydraulic and swab/surge simulations, pore pressure estimation, gas component analysis and day to day reporting of operational parameters. The mudloggers were responsible for cuttings sample collection and analysis.GENERAL DATA 1-2 Location Map .///LOCATION MAP 2 SE FL192 F1194 PLI96 4i.

The bit was a 81/2 Hughes ATMGT18 (3x16) and drilled and orientated as necessary to 3032mMD/2446.3mTVD. The angle was built up from 54.3 to 60.9 and the azimuth turned from 69.0 to 75.3 The next bit run was 81/2 Hughes ATMGTP09 (3x16) and drilled from 3032mMD/2446.3mTVD to 3188mMD/2537.2mTVD, rotating and orientating as necessary and the angle dropped from 60.9 to 49.4 and the azimuth turned from 75.3 to 87.3. 56m3 mud loss was initially observed while circulating before commencing the drilling at 3032mMD/2556.3mTVD, the loss was thought to be due to the Brent sands at 2730mMD, and perhaps the Cook sands. A 81/2 M5OP (4x11, 4x12) was then run with holding assembly and drilled from 3188mMD/2537.2mTVD to 3420mMD/2685.3mTVD TD. Some brine pills were pumped to try and improve the rop but had very little effect. drill break was flowchecked at 3370mMD/2651.9mTVD, and the sample was circulated up, which proved to be the top Statfjord sand. At TD the hole was circulated and wiper trip performed to the shoe where it was circulated again with 11m3 mud loss. The bit was run back to TD and the hole again circulated and the bit then pulled. The mud weight was maintained at sg throughout this section. The hole was then logged with West,=,-, W-H-1-;.1c. During the lr logging run (FMT), the logging tool got stuck at 2557raiviD/2172.2mTVD. The line was cut and fishing tool run on 5DP to free the fish, 40t overpull was required to free the fish, all the fish was recovered. The rest of the logging was completed with no problems. The hole was finally plugged and abandoned.DRILLING DATA 11-2 Well Profile Plot doZZPage 11.2-1 WEL- _fiROFI__iE STATO WELL 34/10-41ST2 SEABED 30 CASING SHOE 36 SECTION TD 20 CASING SHOE 26 SECTION TD 9 5/8 CASING SHOE 12 1/4 SECTION TD SIDETRACK START 81/2 SECTION TD TMD (mBRT) TVD (mBRT)DRILLING DATA 11-3 Deviation Surveys Meosef(vices ///DEVIATION SURVEYS Page : 11-3-1 PROPOSED TARGET (E-Iii) = REACHED COORDINATES (E-) = Y (N-S) = (N-S) = THEORETICAL AZIMUTH = N75.45E MEAN AZIMUTH = N73.97E Computed with Minimum Radius of Curvature method SURVEY Nb DRILLED VERTICAL DEPTH nit DEPTH AZIMUTH dec.deg DRIFT dec.deg DEPARTURE (E-W) nit (N-S) VERTICAL SECTION TOTAL DEPARTURE COG-LEG deg/lam SURVEY TYPEDRILLING DATA 11-4 Days Verus Depth Plot .//,'e PROGRESS PLOT STATOIL Meo4rvices WELL: 34/10-41ST2 PAGE 11-4-1 Om -500m -1000 in Plug & Abandon -1500m -2000m -2500m Sidetrack from 2913mMD -3000m Wireline logging -3500m -4000m DAYS ACTUALGEOLOGY / PRESSURE III-1 Geological SummaryGEOSERVICES Well :34/10-41ST2 FINAL WELL GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY REPORT Page : III-1-1 This geological summary is intended as brief synopsis of the different lithology drilled during well 34/10-41ST2.

The data used for each estimate is provided, together with comments on any anomalies or other significant points. For more information d-exponent plot is included in section 111-6 and Pressure Evaluation Log may be found in Appendix B. The d- exponent curve on these logs is plotted from on-line drilling data corrected for ECD. No correction is made for bit wear. Section 111-7 of this report contains list of recored gas peaks. The formation and fracture pressure estimates based on the d-exponent utilized modified Eaton equations. Local overburden (S) gradient coefficients were calculated from the overburden gradient prognosis. Local Poisson coefficients were also calculated using previous leak-off test results from correlated wells. The values for the coefficients are given below: aS = aK = bS = bK = CS = In addition to the d-exponent, the main pressure analysis tool was gas data (background gas levels, connection gases, trip gases etc). Other formation pressure information was derived from hole condition, torque and drag, mud temperature, mud gains and losses and the presence of cavings. All gas values used in this pressure discussion are total hydrocarbon gas, expressed in equivalent methane, recorded by the GEOSERVICES Gaslogger FID. For trip and connection gas peaks the background gas level is given in brackets. The 81/2 section was drilled in three bit runs. The mud weight was kept at sg throughout the section. The d-exponent trend line was initially shifted to the right to allow for the change in hole size from 121/4 to 81/2. The pore pressure was estimated at sg at the start of this section. The d-exponent does not show any real change in the pore pressure until the Amundsen formation where it drops to the left possibly indicating drop in the pore pressure. The background gas levels remained level through the Drake, Cook, and Burton formations, and gradually decreases through the Amundsen formation, this could indicate decrease in the pore pressure down to sg. The background gas increases on entering the Statfjord but this is formation gas from the sands.GEOSERVICES Well :34/10-41ST2I END OF PRESSURE DISCUSSION WELL REPORT Page : 111-3-2 On entering the Statfjord sands the d-empcnent bec=ies very erl:atic and is not useful tool for pore pressure calculations. The increase in the gas reflect the sand zones. The resistivity also became very erratic. The pore pressure is thought to have dropped in the Statfjord due to the high sand/shale ratio down to sg at its base. Some connection gases were seen through out this section but remained at constant level and where not thought to be pressure related. They were reported as possible connection gases.
