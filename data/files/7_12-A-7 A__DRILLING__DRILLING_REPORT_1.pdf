BP Norge Lila Coiled Tubing Drilling Well A07 October 6, 1996 WELLBORE: 7/12-A-7 COILED TUBING DRILLING SUMMARY ULA AO7A 1. SUMMARY RUN BY RUN Run # Set Baker bridgeplug at 3300mbrt and test tubing to 3900 psi. As operation was halted due to reinstating barrier in well 09 (A-15), rigup and toolstring was made up in advance of commencing run at hrs 23.09.96. RIH with 3/8Baker Thru Tubing Retrievable Bridge Plug (TTRBP) and needed to work through hanger pulling up/down few times. Got restriction at DHSV at 180mbrt and was unable to pass. Attempted to run slowly in, run in fast, run in with circulation of bbl/min with different downweights, from 2000 lbs to 3000 lbs, and speeds. Sat down max 6500 lbs before pulling out. Found that shearpins (3ea 3/8-16 brass screws) on lower element was sheared and no other marks. This indicated that bridgeplug lower element had landed on top of DHSV, as weight on this point is the only way to shear these pins. The small pipe between the bullnose and the packing section is ideal for hanging up, I.E. in DHSV. To come around the problem, the bullnose was modified, ring was welded on to increase the outer diameter to 3.75. In addition the toolstring was prolonged from 5.1m to 6.9m and the coil was bent opposite its natural bending. There was no x-over available from Baker toolstring to Dowell or Maritime well tools, so centralisation and knuckle joints was not an issue. Run # Set Baker bridgeplug at 3300mbrt and test tubing to 3800 psi. The modified bullnose was installed on new Baker retrievable bridgeplug (TTRBP), toolstring length of 6.9m and the coil bent as straight as possible. No restrictions was seen when running in hole. At 3300mbrt, downweight 11000 lbs,upweight 23500 lbs. The bridgeplug was set without any problems by installing ' ball and pumping it over the coil tubing gooseneck at bpm. Let ball fall from gooseneck and down. Pressured up at bpm to 1980 psi and waited hrs to let fluid heat up. Good indication, pressuredrop, as ports shifted. Slacked off 2000 lbs downweight and inflated the packer element. Pumped first coil up to 3500 psi, then annulus to 3000 psi, then coil to 4000 psi and finally annulus to 3800 psi. Tested completion tubing to 3800 psi/30 min. Ok. Production bled annulus pressure to 500 psi. Pressured up coil to 4200 psi where Pressure Activated Sleeve Valve opened and pumping could commence. Pumped until wellhead pressure was equal to SIWHP of 1400 psi. Pulled 3.8m, 6000 lbs overpull ( 28000 lbs upweight) to deflate bridgeplug. Waited 30 min for bridgeplug to deflate properly. POOH at 20 m/min . Inspected bridgeplug at surface and nothing was missing. Run # Run Venturi junk basket to TOC at 3895mbrt. The venturi junk basket assy had previously been made up on pipedeck and was quickly made up to coil. No restriction was seen running in. Performed pulltests evry 700m. RIH to 3881mbrt on mechanical depth counter and opened well for flow at max rate , WHP 600 psi. Pumped through coil using rigpumps at bbl/min at 2400 psi coil pressure and 300 psi wellhead pressure. Ran in at m/min and tagged ID at 3892mbrt on mechanical depth counter,3882mbrt on electrical depth counter. Tagged TD times and last time setting down 80001bs weight. Pulled up 10m and production closed in well on wingvalve. POOH. Out of hole at hrs. Found cups of debris in venturi Run # Drill out shoetrack, shoe and clean out shoetrack. Drill max 15m formation if possible. Checked jars and found cracked sleeve in Jars at hrs.BP Norge Ula Coiled Tubing Drilling Run # As this was the only jar onboard, replcit was not available, jar had to be flown to the rig from Aberdeen. The jar arrived at 20 22 hrs. Documentation was faxed out to the rig as it was not supplied with the tool. Made up assy.and home modified 7/8 mill wich had showed success on A-02. RIH without problems. Started wellflowing for production at full rate at 3000BPD at 400 psi WHP. At the same time pumping at bpm through coil to cool motor. Tagged bootom at 3881mbrt wich was llm higher than the day before. Took up weight to 33500 lbs and slackoff weight to 15000 lbs adjusted circulation rate to bpm at 3850 psi. Milled cement and shoe from 3881mbrt to 3886.9mbrt.with 2000 lbs WOB and 3950 psi on bottom pressure.The milling was smooth and pressure kept konstant of 100 psi differential. At mbrt the motor stalled out and pressure increased from 3950 psi to 4900 psi before the pumps was slowed down to bpm at 2600 psi (to keep cooling effect on motor). Pulled up 10 Klb and jar went off causing the string to be free. Pulled up and increased pumprate to bpm at 3200 psi. Observed the pressuredrop. Attempted to continue milling with 2000 lbs weight,no progress. Increased WOB gradually up to 8000 lbs, but no pressure increase was seen. No progress POOH. Found that string had parted in the Trinity Quick disconnect sub,leaving dovvnhole: 0.39m quick disconn, x/o, 3*DC, x/o, Quick disconnect, x/o, 2*DC, Circ sub, Navydrill, mill. The parting had happened as if the disconnecting sequence had been performed for this tool, and no breakage or marks was seen on end. The disconnecting sequence is stages and unexplainable??. Fishing lost string from BHA #4 The fishing graple for 1/8 fish was not onboard and helokopter was needed to bring it out. The fishing assembly (BHA#5) was made up and run in hole without problems. Performed pulltests and noted upweight every 500m. At 3830mbrt, the cement pump was lined up to the reel, but no pumping was performed throughout the fishing operation. Upweight was 22000 lbs,wellhead pressure and coil pressure at 1400 psi. Run in slowly and tagged fish at 3860.1mbrt and set down 10 Klbs. Pulled up 10- 20m. Run in at varying speeds 10-15-20 m/min and set down 12 Klbs weight to verify latch. Pulled up and saw small weight increase. POOH without any problems and tagged the stripper with 10 Klbs. Closed LMV. Attempted to close swabvalve, got 10 turns, indicating length of fish.Got problems with leak on LMV wich was fixed by greasing the valve. Closed well on DHSV and LMV with good tests. Retrieved all fish and broke all connections. The Trinity quick disconnect was checked, and all parts were present and nothing indicated the reason for the parting. The top of the fish had lot of cmt pieses on top and all the connections had small steel and brass bits. In the Navydrill there was lot of pins of steel and brass, presumably from the wireline retrievable DHSVs that has been changed over the years. Small steel pieses like milled cuttings were also present, indicating that the mill had been milling. The reason it was all inside the fish, could be from it beeing in suspension in the liner when flowing the well, and has fallen down when the well was shut in. It is estimated that we are partly through the shoe, and that there will be more steel cuttings to come from further milling. Therfore mill was chosen to be run. As there were nothing abnormal to be seen from the Trinity connectors telling why it parted it was decided to take these out of the drillstring and further operation. Milling cement, shoe, rathole and max 20m new formation. Every part of the fish was well cleaned and inspected visually, and the motor and Trinity connectors were removed from the drillstring. The motor beeing full of small metal pieces and the Trinity connector failed. The same mill were run as htere were no sign of wear or damage except from beeing slightly undergauge (only mill option). While running in,BP Norge Ula Coiled Tubing Drilling Well A07 there were hangups at 2730mbrt and at 3300mbrt, but came through. Junk?. At bottom at 3887 6mbrt it was suspected som junk, and the motor stalled out several times, total 6. By setting low weight, 2000 lbs, and timedrilling with in/hr the motor was kept going. Every stallout takes about 30 min to get back to bottom, so keeping slow penetration rate was better than none. The first meter took hrs and then it broke through the shoe. From 3888mbrt the drilling went easyer and it seemed that the rathole was free from cement. While drilling the shoe and the rathole, the pressure kept increasing, presumably due to shoe and the smaller 7/8 hole through the cement making restriction. The pressure increase was approx 600 psi when pumping at bpm. Finally needed to reduce the strokes to bpm. Continued cleaning out the rathole to 3898mbrt and made lm new formation to 3899.4mbrt. As part of test with scale inhibitor, wich had been shut down due to production plant problems, scale inhibitor were again pumped. When scale inhibitor was expected in returns, it was reported that the differential pressure over the flowline screeen increased to 23 bar. The maximum for this was 25 bar, and the drilling was stopped. When circulating/flowing bottoms up, the pressure increased to 27 bar. Closed in on wellflow from 52% choke to 30% choke opening. Circulated with bpm to cool motor. Needed to pump bpm to keep pressure below 25 bar differential at flowline screen. POOH. Run # Milling new hole to max 3908mbrt The same mill used in run #4 and #6 was rerun as the mill was good enough. It was slightly undergauge, so the spare mill was checked. This was the same. The plan was to drill max 20m from the shoe, so that we were positive that new formation was drilled when running the turbine and diamond bit. RIB to 3880mbrt and pumped at 2.9bpm at 4200 psi. Reamed down slowly from 3880mbrt to 3891 mbrt where the motor stalled. The same was repeated once more, and then reamed from 3880 to 3896.5m where bottom was hit. As this is higher than the previous run, the estimated depth was 3899mbrt. Approx 2.5m was milled in hrs with 3.1 bpm at 4400 psi pressure. Several attempts was done to mill further without success. Equipment failure like not calibratyed CT weightcell and a not working pressuregauge made things difficult. Motor stalled out and pipe got stuck at 3894m with signs of hole packing off. Sveral attempts was made to pull free without the jar firing. String was pulled to 70000Ibs (430001bs overpull) and the jar went off and string came free.POOH. Run # The venturi junkbasket was run, operated and pulled without problems. This tool has shown to be reliable. It recovered approx kg junk, wherof several pieces of steel justr big enough to fit inside the basket. The basket was 1/2 full, the screen was not plugged and the outer and inner fingers were all closed. The assumption is that the hole is free from more junk. The flowline filter (screen), contained kg steel pices simmilar to the ones retrieved with the venturi, and hopefully all the junk is out of the hole. Drill 7/8 hole using diamond bit and turbine to 4054mbrt. After lot of problems at surface, gooseneck,torquecell and weight indicator, the BHA was finally run. Tagged bottom with low pumprate at lbpm at 1900 psi. Pulled above shoe and pumped at 2bpm at 4000 psi. Turbine stalled times before able to make hole. When drilling the pressure fell 100 psi from 4000 psi to 3900 psi. Drilled only on pressure,weight varied from 1500-40001bs. ROP was held back to max 6m/hr. The turbine stalled few times due to hard slackoff and then pressure fell 300 psi. The pumps was reduced to lbpm at 2000 psi,string pulled 4m,pumps incerased to 2.0bpm at 4000 psi. Afetr discussion, the max ROP was set to 10m/hr, and there were not probllems drilling. Drilled from 3899mbrt to 3914mbrt, Took good survey at 3905m, and attempted to take survey at 3914mbrt.October 1996 No signals was received at surface. Trtied varying pumpspeeds, pressureincreasing etc, but no signal came to surface. After discussion, it was decided to continue another 20m. Drilled from 3914mbrt to 3934mbrt with ROPs on bottom at lOtn/hr. It seemed that even higher ROPs could be achieved.Reamed every 10m and no overpull or pressure differences were seen. At 3934mbrt attempts to get survey was done, but no signals came to surface.Drilling pressure at 3900 psi with 2.0bpm and 100 psi differential over the turbine. No difference drilling Ula formation from 3899m to 3921mbrt, Bryne formation from 3921mbrt to 3932mbrt or Trias from 3932mbrt.Reamed the whole section and no overpull or pressure differences were seeen. CCR were flowing wells through the seperator and had problems telling any increased flow, but reported increased gas from MT/day to 3.3MT/day. Presumably the increase came from A07a. As the survey tool was not operative, the decission to POOH was made.The BHA was checked, and the bit was showing junk damages on the on gauge and shank. The nose looked ok. MWD was examined, but no conclusive failure was to be seen. The motor was checked, 0.2mm bearing wear, and was good for another run. Run # 10 Drill 7/8 hole using diamond bit and turbine to 4054mbrt. A new MWD and new bir was run, the rest of the BHA#10 was same as BHA#9. RIH to 700mbrt and tested the MWD. Very weak signals that could not be interpreted. POOH to change MWD.When bleeding off riser,the drain from flowline to closed drain was plugged and took extra time. As an Ekofisk shutdown occured, the drain was not repaired until after nin#11. Run#11 The MWD was surface tested by removing the bit and installing a sub with nozzle for pressuredrop. The injectorhead was installed and pressured up the riser by holding back on rigchoke to simulate downhole situation Ok. Run#12 Run#13 Run#14 Run#15 Ru no.

The diamond bit was run to TD and pulled off bottom. Tagged with 50 psi pressure difference over motor and let it stay for 30 min to clean bottom, make holepath and drill in bit carefully. Put weight on with pressuredrop 100 psi and drilled first meter in 30 min. Increased ROP to 6m/hr and no problems with that. After discussions the ROP max was increased to 10m/hr due to holecleaning.(2bpm at 4000 psi). Drilling was easy and ROPs couldhave been lot higher. The bit performed very well, and it is believed that this bit could have drilled further on. Pulled due to MWD failure. 00H grading:1,4,LT,G,X,1,JD,DTF The junk damages on gauge and bitshank was severe. 2.4 Torque machine There were no torque machine on this job. The make up and breaking was done by Pipe wrenches and loadcell in between for accurat Torque. This worked for making of toostrings and then the loadcell failed. No spare toqueing methods were present, so the rig loadcell and instruments was used. This is made for pipe and DC of larger sizes and are not fit for slim hole equipment. 2.5 Downhole problems/junk BHA #5 Lots of junk inside the fish. Pieces of shearpins ?? of brass and steel, presumably coming form DHSV change outs over the years??. B HA#6 The junk seen in fish was estimated to also be on bottom, and so it was. The motor stalled out several times and it was needed to timedrill at 0.6m/hr to keep the mill on bottom. As this also was at the shoe, aided in not torqueing up when breaking through. BHA #7 There wer marks on the mill that could come from junk. When stuck for hrs, it seemed that the hole was packing off as the pressure increased. This could also come from junk stalling the motor. BHA#8 Approx kg steel junk retrieved in Venturi. Pieces up to 2cm square and lot of cm3 pieces were retrieved Also kg of the same junk pieces were retrieved from the flowline screen. B HA#9 Junk damages were seen on gauge and shank of the bit. 2.6 Temperature 3. DISCUSSION & RECOMMENDATIONS Run #1 Set Baker bridgeplug at 3300mbrt and test tubing. Was not able to pass DHSV at 180mbrt. Attempted several times before POOH. Found that shearpins (3ea 3/8-16 brass screws) on lower element was sheared and no other marks. This indicated that bridgeplug lower element had landed on top of DHSV, as weight on this point is the only way to shear these pins. The small pipe between the bullnose and the packing section is ideal for hanging up, I.E. in DHSV. To come around the problem, the bullnose was modified, ring was welded on to increase the outer diameter to . In addition the toolstring was prolonged from 5.1m to 9m and the coil was bent opposite its natural bending. Recommendations: 1.There was no x-over available from Baker toolstring to Dowell or Maritime well tools, so centralisation and knuckle joints was not an issue. On future CT drilling operations x-overs should be onboard for actual sizes threads also for subcontractor equipment. It is recommended that the Dowell onshore support is strengthened for CT drilling operations. 2. Baker did not have over,knuckle joint or centralization. It is recommended that bridgeplugs are supplied with these tools for future CT operations. 3.By increasing the OD of the bullnose to 3.75, increasing the toolstring length from 5.1m to 69m and bending the coil straight, there was no problem passing DHSV. This shoulkd be part of operating procedures on future wells. Run#3 Venturi run to 3892mbrt to clean up well ahead of drilling. 1.When out of hole with the venturi junk basket the jars was checked. Found cracked sleeve on operating piston wich made it unfit for further use. repkit wich was ordered for this jar, did not contain the cracked part. This jar had been in use in A-02 and not been checked afterwards. 2. There was only one jar onboard, and the closest one available was found in Aberdeen and flown to the rig. On arrival the dokumentation was not present. The waiting time for new jar, was 12 hrs. Recommendations: 1. It is recommended to have jars onboard when drilling. 3. The Dowell quality system wiled to catch up the lack of inspection on the failed iar. even after been told by cre.w members. The re.nkit was not {ANBP Norge Ula Coiled Tubing Drilling Well A07 quality system is revised and improved and the onshor CT support is strengthened.. Run#4 1.The Trinity quick disconnect parted leaving the BHA downhole. The end showed no marks or damages, and it looked as if the disconnecting sequence had been done. This is hard to explain. 2.When finding the fishing equipment there is one graple missing, the one needed. The ordering ticket staites from 7/8-3 3/8, and only the end sizes was delivered. 1. As the reason for the failure on the Trinity quick connection is hard to establish, it is recommended that these tools are removed from CT drilling service until reason is found. Possibilities as spring breakage on torque should be examined. 2. The grapple missing, showes the need for improving the quality system and the onshore support for the Dowell CT drilling operations. It is recommended that recources are channeled into quality and support. Run #5 The 7/8 Bowen overshot was flown on to the rig and performed well. It is recommended to have this type of overshot for CT drilling operations for the future over the wireline type. It is also recommended to have sets of graples and controls for each size pipe in the hole.( 7/8, 1/8 and 3/8) Run#6 1.The 7/8 mill was slightly undergauge and the spare was the same. It is recommended to have mills full gauge when milling to avoid stuck problems when running full size bits afterwards. 2. The flowline screen plugged up when testbatch containing liters/60 m3 scale inhibitor reached surface This seems to be coincident, but it is recommended to avoid testing production plant while drilling to minimize the uncertainties in parameters. 3. The nessesity to POOH to clean flowline screen is very timeconsuming. It is recommended to install valves on flowline so that the screen can be cleaned ot and still have the barriers in place. Run #7 1.The HMV was difficult to close, and it was suspected due to scale buildup on valve. Due to production was reduced when scale inhibitor came into plant, the amount of inhibitor was reduced from liters /60 m3 to liters/60 m3. It is recommended that scale inhibitor is used at recommended amount to avoid buildup from scale in x-mas-tree valves when drilling. 2. The hydraulic master was finally closed by using the platform hydraulic system. This seemed to do the trick and are recommended as backup procedure for the future. 3. The weight indicator and the pressure gauge in the CT cabin was showing the wrong values. Then it is very difficult to keep accurat torque on the M1XL motor and mill working. It also led to pressure on rigfloor going up to max 5200 psi without relief valve opening. It is recommended that relief valves on rig mudpumps are correctly calibrated in advance and that spare relief valves are present. It is also recommended that the weight indicator system are made more rigid and easy to repair. 4. There are backup system in CT cab, the digital weight and pressures, and it seemed that these were working. The time to update the data was too slow, leading to high weights and pressures when milling. There is need for improvement on this system as it is vital. Run #8 Venturi to TD to clean up junk. 1. The venturi junkbasket has proved to be reliable in catching junk and are recommended to be used on future CT drilling operations. 2. The torque on slim hole tools were done by pipewrenches and loadcell in between. As this failed when making up BHA#9, the rig cell and instrument had to be used. It is recommended that proper equipment for toquesettin2 are present for future wells.BP Norge Ula Coiled Tubing Drilling October 7, 1996 Run#9 Drill 7/8 hole from 3902mbrt to 3982mbrt. 1.The Neyfor T2 motor performed well and clear pressuredrops were seen when drilling or stalling. The motor is recommended for future CT drilling in and below the Ula reservoir. 2.The Smith D72HT diamond bit performed very well, and ROPs above 10m/hr can be expected in future drilling in the lower part of Ula sand,Bryne and Trias formations with underbalanced CT drilling. This bit is recommended for future CT drilling in this area. 3. The Slim-1 MWD tool was tested at surface.0k, and worked for one survey taken at bitdepth 3905mbrt. Afterwards no signals were received at surface. The position of the hole was critical and trip was necessary. It is recommended that further recources are put into developping the tool to be more reliable, as this is repetetive problem, also for coventional drilling.The reason for the failure could not be established offshore, and it is recommended that this is closer investigated onshore and that report are made to Ula and UGAL. Run #10 Drill 7/8 hole from 3902mbrt to 3982mbrt. The second Slim-1 MWD failed at surface test at 700mbrt.POOH and changed out same. The failure probably fram wrongly set alignment torque, and there were observed that the tool directing the flow was not properly into the barrel. This is human error and are corrected offshoe. It is recommended that proper tools for setting torque are available offshore. Run#11 Drill 7/8 hole from 3982mbrt to 4057 mbrt. The MWD tool was changed out and tested on surface using nozzleplug on turbine. Surface test were Okit is recommended that this surface testing procedure to be done ahead of every MWD run. The survey tool was working with just minor problems down to 4030 m. In attemt to get survey we tried to reduce the pumprate to 18 spm whilst taking survey instead of 13 spm as previous surveys.-Neg. Changed to Dowell ccement pump for taking survey and got the survey in first attempt with very clear signal. If problems with rig pumps to take survey , we recomend to change to Dowell unit. At TD the MWD tool failed to give good survey. When at TD made wipertrip to shoe at 3910 m. No excessive overpull. Ran back to bottom and reamed through spot at 4050 m. OK. POOH. After swab closed and tested the BHA and the tool string was pulled and laid out deck. The bit was graded 2-3-WT-A-X-I-NO-LOG. It looked fairly ok. Also the turbine came out in good condition. The stabilizers on the turbine was all ingage.The MWD tool failed to take survey on bottom. When out of hole it was found electronic failure had stopped the signal unit from turning This was possibly caused by heat.

Moved all MWS equipment from drill floor to BOP deck. Prepared MWS slick line on A-08 (well 17). Whilst preparing the MWS equipment on A-08, an attempt was made to test the shear seal valve on A-07 to 5000 psi. The test was not successful and when opening the shear seal after having bled of the pressure, trapped pressure caused an oil/water/grease mixture to be blown out of the well. Drill floor and the north/ east side of the rig had to be washed down before rigging up MWS on BOP deck could continue. Whilst washing the shear seal on A-07 was successfully tested to 5000 psi-15 min. At 2030 firs the CCR was asked by the MWS wireline supervisor what shut in pressure they had on A-08A. This because the MWS riser only can be tested to 207 bar ( 3000 psi), and we wanted to do as much preparation as possible whilst waiting. They answered that he had to wait because they had problems with the water injection that had tripped. Whilst waiting on production the crew continued to wash down the rig. Also the BHA for the kick off was made up and the motor and the orienting tool was tested. OK. Production informed that the SIWHP on A-08 was 205 bar (2980 psi). And therefore it was decided to pump sufficient sg CaC12 to reduce the SIWHP to approx. 2500 psi. pm job meeting was held in the CCR with : OWS-WMS-OTL/P-MWS supervisor-Dowell supervisor. After the pre job meeting chick sands was rigged up from kill wing valve to the kill manifold and successfully tested to 5000 psi. 130 bbls sg CaCl2 was then pumped into the well. The pressure was observed for 30 min and dropped to 179 bar ( 2600 psi). Another 30 bbls was pumped into the well and the SIWHP was reduced to the desired 172 bar ( 2500 psi). The UMV was lealdng on first attempt to inflow test. The UMV was then greased up and then successfully inflow tested at 0555 hrs. Rig up MWS wire line F.O.G , and lubricator. The DHSV was successfully repaired with the flow tube puller. After successful inflow test with 160 bar SIWHF' the X-mas tree was tested .=OK.

Incident report UGAL 50 on Slim MWD tool failure due to wrong tool assembly. Problems with the Injector head running in weights were due to the goose neck alignment on the CT going into the Injector head. This was modified and the problem rectified. Signals from the MWD survey improved 100% when the pumping was changed from the mud pumps to the cement unit. This is probably due to the discharge damper on the mud pumps causing noise.

The objective was to identify positive aspects as well as things that could have been done better. The findings from the meeting are presented below and supplement the recommendations given in the end of well report. prepared by Dowell. ATTENDEES: BP: Prode Berge, Kai Bue, Ivar Games, Hans Gruner, Helger Thoreby, Geoff Weighill, David Wilkinson. UGAL: Jens Holme, Bjorn Jensen, Reynaldo Llosa, Lars Myrholt, Einar Nees, Mark Walker. THINGS DONE WELL 1. Well Clean-up (Venturi Junk Basket and Jet Nozzle). A total of venturi junk basket runs were made to the top of the liner cement plug prior to the second attempt at coiled tubing drilling (CI__)) in November 1995. Debris from the first CTD attempt in January 1995 had to be removed before further drilling could go ahead. This was mainly rubber from damaged motor stators and caused poor drilling performance in the first attempt. Some loose sand was also recovered. The junk baskets made good recovery and were re-run until no further debris was seen The good CTD performance in the shoe track was attributed to the efficient hole cleaning by the junk baskets. A jet nozzle was run into the sump below the liner shoe prior to drilling new formation. This was to ensure that any loose cement would not fall in behind the bit and risk packing off the bottom hole assembly (BHA). The sump was thoroughly cleaned and circulated out and the subsequent formation drilling went ahead without any problems due to debris. 2. Flowline strainer. A strainer was installed in the A02 flowline to remove coarse particles of debris that could be produced during the coiled tubing drilling operation. On the first CT drilling operation in January 1995, rubber debris from the downhole motor caused blockages in the produced water control valves, hydrocyclones and test separator instrumentation and resulted in reduced production. The strainer proved effective at trapping debris while allowing the fluid returns and fine cuttings particles to pass through. Differential pressure was monitored by the coiled tubing crew and did not exceed the 25 bar design limit during drilling operations. The strainer was checked and cleaned out during trips and this operation took approximately 30 minutes.The strainer was considered fit for purpose and was recommended for future operations although dual filter system may be required for more complex operations where longer bit runs are anticipated. Some reduction in produced water quality may have occurred and wet wells were choked back due to the high water production during drilling, resulting in some MBD deferred oil production. 3. Procedures and Organisation. There was general satisfaction with the procedures and organisation for the job but some areas for improvement were noted. Lessons:  Include all details in the main operational manual produced by Dowell, e g.: logging requirements.  Need extra support offshore for reporting, especially in the early stages of the operation.  Final reports should be produced on Mac and stored on DEAP.  Dowell data gathering using their PC based system was satisfactory and was complimented by the NPD.  Communication in UGAL needs to be improved and single contact should be appointed, ideally the UGAL Well Management or Data Acquisition Team Leader.  Offshore 24 hour cover needs to be agreed before the job starts.  Modifications to the deployment procedures were acceptable but should have been formally approved. Teamwork was recognised as success but improvements in communication with offshore and within UGAL are recommended. 4. Surface Equipment. The coiled tubing surface equipment worked well with no breakdowns although there was some time lost due to leaks in the deployment system However, the logging pressure control equipment was not suitable for the surface pressures and time was lost due to leaks. Lesson: No lessons noted. 5. Drilling Performance. Penetration rates up to metres/hour were achieved and there was general satisfaction with this performance. The well was drilled with very high under balance (ca. 1500 psi). This was not realised until the bottom hole pressure was confirmed from the PLT log after drilling was completed. Although this was cause for concern, there was no evidence of hole problems attributed to high under balance. Lesson: Under balance requirements should be reviewed for future jobs. 6. Wellbore Hydraulics / Produced Water Handling. Pumping rates of ca. bbl/min (4300 b/d) were achieved using coil and good hole cleaning was achieved. Fewer viscous pills were requiredcompared with the first attempt with 3, coil Minimal friction reducer was required for motor lubrication. Additional lift was provided by flowing the Jurassic water zone at ca. 9000 b/d but this resulted in water handing limitations and wet wells had to be choked back, resulting in some reduction in oil production. Lessons: Future Triassic deepening should consider isolating the Jurassic water zone first. Full hydraulic modelling should be carried out on future well planning and drill rates should be coritrolled to ensure adequate hole cleaning using circulated fluid and Triassic production only. 2 3/8 coil should be considered for future drilling operations where no additional zones will be contributing flow, e.g.. Unit side-tracks. 7. Liner Acidisation. The liner deployment and acidisation of the aluminium plugs was carried out successfully and the well performance was in line with expectation. However, flow distribution into the liner is uncertain and further investigation is recommended. THINGS TO DO BETTER. 1. Incidents. There were reported incidents during the CT drilling operation of which was reported to the NPD.  CT indexing tool parted during lifting operation and fell 10 metres onto BOP deck. The main contributing factor was poor visibility for BOP crane operator in BOP deck area during the lifting operation. Incident was reported to NPD and was referred to in the NPD report on the AO2A CT drilling. Lesson: Improve lighting in BOP deck area and improve communication during lifting operations. Prepare critical task analysis for lifting operations in BOP deck area.  Dropped BHA in hole during deployment out due to kinked wire in lubricator. Approx. 25 metres of BHA fell to bottom, through the closed DHSV. However, the DHSV was equalised and therefore not damaged although the reason for this was not reported. The incident was not initially reported to the NPD but was picked up during the audit. Lesson: Tag the wire when deploying the BHA.  Venturi junk basket was lost in hole during initial clean-up operations The main contributing factor was an incompatible thread in the Baker temperature sub. Lesson: Check all equipment onshore before shipping to platform and arrange 3rd party inspection of threads. Open hole logging tools were lost in hole when the cable was cut by the DHSV while pulling out due to leak in grease head. The condition of the logging surface equipment was not up to standard. Lesson: Wireline logging surface equipment should be re-dressed before sending offshore.  H2S scavenger was not used in acidisation of the aluminium liner plugs, risking corrosion in topsides facilities. Lesson: Flag in operations procedures.  Leaking valves on 3rd party choke manifold. Lesson: Improved QA procedures are now in place.  Hydraulic master valve closed while BHA still in hole during deploynient out. Lesson: Greater control of deployment operations required from WMS.  Broken air hose on winch resulting in lubricator falling to BOP deck. Lesson: No lesson noted 2. Contingency Fishing Equipment. A full set of fishing tools were not kept on stand-by offshore, resulting in some lost time during mobilisation. The policy not to keep stand-by tools offshore was based on high costs incurred during the previous CT drilling operation. Lesson: In future operations, an evaluation should be carried out on the cost of fishing tools offshore vs. risk of use. This must be flagged in the programme. 3. Difficult Working Environment on BOP Deck. Working conditions for AO2A CT drilling on the BOP deck were difficult due to poor lighting and limited space for the equipment during SIMOPS with drilling operations. These points were highlighted in the NPD report with specific reference to the dropped object incident described in Item above. Lesson: Avoid CT drilling operations from the Ula BOP deck in future. If this is unavoidable, lighting must be improved and more space created by removing the spare drilling BOP. 4. Deployment Procedures. The original deployment procedures were simplified offshore to reduce the number of pressure tests. The WHP was checked to be zero then the pipe slips were opened instead of testing between the annular preventer and pipe slips each time the lubricator was broken out. The barriers during this procedure were: DHSV, pipe slips and shear seal as back-up. This procedure is used in Norway by Statoil and Amoco while deploying perforation guns.Lesson: Future deployment operations should use double '0' ring riser connection which can be tested after each make-up. Refer to recommended deployment procedure in Dowell AO2A end of well report. 5. Motor Seizure. A Baker motors were operating at the recommended temperature limit (325 F) and the motor seized after the BHA became stuck while drilling the shoe. Anadrill motors performed better at Ula temperatures but delivered low torque. However, this was sufficient when using the Speed mill. The failed motor on Run # 15 was attributed to faulty elastomer bonding to the motor housing and the investigation report is still pending. Lesson: Keep motors turning and avoid getting stuck. 6. Motor Clearance Through the Liner Shoe. The risk of debris from the rathole packing off around the motor inside the liner shoe was highlighted (clearance = 3/8 with the Baker Navidrill). Also risk of erosion to the motor housing due to high fluid velocity. Lesson: The liner shoe should be opened out with mill and the rat hole should be jetted out before drilling the formation. 7. Coiled Tubing Depth Control. A metre discrepancy between CT depth and casing tally depth was reported. Lesson: CT depth must be correlated and tied in with known completion components on future drilling operations. 8. Liner Release Tool. The Baker liner release tool did not have circulation ports. As consequence of this, no pressure drop indication was seen when the ball shifted the liner release sleeve. In the event, the tool did work correctly but some 2-3 hours were lost trying to determine if the liner had been released. Accurate drawings of the tool were not available offshore. Lesson: Future liner release tools should have circulation ports and drawings of the tool should be kept offshore. 9. Deck Loading with Coil. 2 coil filled with SG kill fluid for the Zechstein Salt would exceed the BOP deck loading. Lesson: Future jobs must consider the deck loading for coil filled with kill fluid.

A07 was planned to commence may 1996, complications with the well preparations was the major factor causing the project to delay till September. Equipment was mobilized Friday September 13. The operations was performed without lost time injuries. The drilling operations were be performed from the rigfloor and were conducted underbalance. The well was drilled through the existing production. Sea water will be used as drilling fluid. psi yield coiled tubing was used. During drilling the well was produced to the production facility. removable high pressure screen filter was placed in the flowline to protect the facilities from debris. A total of 199 was drilled using total of motors and one mill and five formation bits. Time from mobilization till demobilization was 39 days. For the first time world wide turbine was run on coiled tubing with good success, average ROP's were higher then achievable with PDM's. The turbine was run four times without being redressed which is remarkable for downhole motors in the Ula- field environment. The real time information transmitted by the Slim-1 MWD system was interfaced by the Anadrill Ideal computer system on the surface. This provided the real-time outputs needed for Directional Drilling and some data from the tool memory. Also available were interpretation programs for use either in real time or to be run off-line. In this well, Slim - MWD tools were used to measure the well- bore Direction and Inclination (D&I), together with toolface measurements. Gamma ray was measured throughout the extension of the well. The tool also transmitted temperature and shock recordings in real time to aid the drilling process. Certain surface data were measured and recorded to aid the MWD service. This data included depth, rate of penetration, and pump pressure. Both the downhole and surface data were collected and processed on the Slim IDEAL system. Two Anadrill MWD engineers were on location at all times. Anadrill provided the drilling tools required to directionally drill the 7/8 phase. These tools included all the required non- magnetic drill collars, float subs, cross overs, UBHO subs, Orienting tools and drilling connectors. The build section was started as planned and the bottomhole assembly performed as anticipated concerning the buildrate. Multiple MWD failures caused the project to be suspended before all objectives were met. The well was produced through the test separator. Due to the size of the this separator another well had to also be flowed through the test separator making flow readings from A07 very difficult. From the samples it could be concluded A07 was not flowing any significant volume of oil. While drilling out the shoetrack the perforations were leaking at rate of approximately 3500 BPD. When the assembly broke through the shoe this rapidly CIDOWELL/CLIENTS/BP/ULA/A07/EOW 30/12/96increased to BPD which is thought to originate from either wet sand just below the shoe or from behind the liner. See also section 8: logging information. 2.0 Well oblectives: The objective of the operation was to improve understanding of Triassic reservoir quality distribution, oil-in-place and productivity The operation was implemented using coiled tubing through the existing completion and was planned to be carried out in four phases; 1) Drill out shoe track of the existing well 2) Drill straight 7/8 hole from 3904m to 4057m through Triassic 3) Log Triassic with gamma/resistivity/sonic run on wireline 4) Build at 35 deg/30m to 90 degrees and drill 50m horizontal to validate coiled tubing drilling for future drilling applications.

Three type of downhole motors were used on the A07 operation; Baker Hughes Inteq Navidrill MK1 This is 1/8 PDM with extended power section. The stator of the motors was made out of high temperature resistant rubber called 7-rubber. The motor was run to drill out the shoetrack and the rathole. In BHA #4 the first motor was used for circulating hours of which hours actual drilling after which the BHA got stuck in the shoe. While jarring the quick connector released leaving the BHA with the motor in the hole. The BHA was fished but the motor could not be re-run. The motor milled cement and steel from 3881 to m. In BHA #6 the second motor was used for 18 circulating hours, of which 12 hours actual drilling before the BHA was pulled due to block filter at surface. The motor milled cement, steel and rathole from to m. The motor was checked at surface and re-run in BHA #7 for another 18 circulating hours of which hours actual drilling. The BHA was pulled to run venturi junkbasket. The motor rathole from to m. Neyrfor T2 turbine The T2 is straight 3/8 turbine. It was the first operation the turbine was run on coiled tubing. The motor was used to drill the deepening section. The turbine was run four trips, of which one is only to 500 due to MWD failure BHA run #9 the turbine was run for 21 circulating hours of which hours actual drilling/reaming. was drilled before the BHA was pulled to change out the MWD tool. BHA run #11 41 circulating hours were performed of which hours actual drilling/reaming. 123 was drilled at average ROP of m/hr before the BHA was pulled for logging. BHA run #12 circulating hours were performed of which hours actual reaming in order to optimize the hole to enable wireline to open log the drilled section. Anadrill A287M powerpack Two types of PDM were used on A07, with the regular stator but more clearance rotor/stator, and with the HSN high saturated nitnle stator. Six motors were used to drill the build section BHA run #13 the PDM with HSN stator was run for hours, of which hours were actual reaming, no new hole was drilled due to MWD failure. C/DOWELUCLIENTS/BP/ULA/A07/LOW 30 12 96BHA run #14 the PDM with regular stator was run for 28 circulating hours, of which hours actual drilling/reaming. Drilled new hole when the BHA was pulled due to MWD problems. BHA run #15 no new formation was drilled due to stator rubber blocking the bit nozzles opening the circulating ports. The PDM had HSN stator. BHA run #16 no new formation was drilled due to MWD failure, after pulling the BHA stator rubber was found in the bit. This PDM had regular stator. BHA run #17 no new formation was drilled due to problems getting past 3910 BRT. Motor with regular stator checked out OK after the run. BHA run #18 was performed to obtain multi shot gyro and now new formation was drilled. CJDOWELLJCLIENTS BP/ULA/A07/EOW 30 12 96Schlurnberger 6.2 Drilling bit evaluation: For the operation one tungsten carbide mill and five formation bits were used. All mills/bits were 7/8 OD. For milling out the shoetrack and the rathole Red Baron bullnose tungsten carbide mill was used. This mill has been used on the previous well drilled with coil and performed again according to expectations One mill was used to drill out the cement, shoetrack and the rathole. For the tangent section the first bit was Smith D72HT natural diamond bit with long gage was run The bit performed well. Regreffully the bit had to be discarded after the first run due to severe damage on the gage due to junk in the well. second bit was not available. CIDOWF,LL CLIENTS 111VULA M7/EOW 30 12 96The tangent section was completed with Hycalog 901U natural diamond bit. This bit was similar to the Smith bit, but with shorter gage. One bit was used to drill the 158 tangent section. For the build section Hycalog 443 diamond impregnated bit was used. Regretfully the bit only drilled 23m of build section due to problems with the MWD system. Primary reason for running the diamond impregnated bit was the non-aggressiveness leading to less stalls with the PDM's increasing there reliability. There was no significant decrease in stalls experienced.

The tool worked well down to 3914m with signal strength of 3-6 psi. At 3914m the string was back- reamed prior to taking survey and the real-time signal was lost. Several attempts were made to restart the tool by cycling the pumps and varying the flow rate, with no success. It was decided to drill on another 20 meters before pulling out of hole. At the surface the pulser(SMA) was found to have stopped and it was not possible to communicate with the tool from the computer. The electronic cartridge (SEA) and gamma ray cartridge (SGR) were sent back to town for further analysis. At the R&M facility it was found that condenser in the SGR had failed causing the fuse to blow in one of the batteries. The tool recorded downhole temperatures of 154 C and some shocks whilst drilling. complete failure report is given in the MWD failure report section.

At 670m the shallow hole test was performed which gave signal strength of 1-2 psi. Our judgement was that this would not be sufficiently strong signal to ensure good decoding whilst drilling and that it was possible to achieve better signal by adjusting the tool at surface. Consequently the string was pulled out of hole. On the surface the tool was found to be functioning normally for the way it had been configured. The weak signal was caused by torque setting to the pulser (SMA) which proved to be inappropriate to the prevailing flow conditions. See MWD failure report section for details.

The shallow hole test was performed at surface this time and gave an signal strength of 3-6 psi. A usable signal was obtained down to 4030m when severe problems in getting survey were experienced. reliable survey was obtained by switching from the rig pumps to Dowell cement pump which gave better quality of signal. Drilling continued with real- time signal to 4050m where great difficulty was found in attempting to decode the signal and no further surveys could be obtained. Drilling continued to TD. at 4057m before pulling out of hole. Transverse shocks of 1-10 and temperatures in excess of 150 C were seen in real time throughout the run. On surface the tool was found to have stopped transmitting but would communicate with the computer allowing memory data to be obtained. Dumping the tool memory gave the necessary survey information from TD, and also showed recorded bottom hole temperature of over 158 C. The tool was returned to Base for failure analysis, the findings are given in MWD failure report 3.

C: DOWELUCLIENTS BIYULA/A07/EOW 30 2966.32 FAILURE REPORTS: MWD FAILURE No.1 RUN No. : Tool No : 227 FAILURE DESCRIPTION. At 3914m the signal was lost when back reaming prior to taking survey. Attempts were made to restart the tool by cycling the pumps and changing flow rates, with no success. Transverse shock from 1-10 was seen throughout the run and occasionally shock values of 11-20. At surface the tool was found to have stopped and it was not possible to communicate with the tool. The battery section was found to be giving volts. FAILURE ANALYSIS. The Slim-1 electronic section and gamma ray section were returned to the Anadrill & facility for further analysis. It was found that leaking condenser in the gamma ray assembly led to short in the high voltage circuit causing the fuse in one of the batteries to blow. Temperature strips are fitted to all our MWD tools and these recorded maximum temperature of 154 C. This is slightly in excess of the rated temperature limit for the tool which is 150 C. degree of shock combined with the high temperatures is the probable cause of failure. MWD FAILURE No.2 Tool No : 337 The shallow hole test was performed at 670m giving signal of only 1-2 psi. The signal strength could not be improved by varying the flow rates and it was judged best to pull out of hole and make adjustments to the pulser(SMA) to obtain better signal and ensure fully-decoded signal whilst drilling. The alignment toque set on the pulser(SMA) was incorrect for these flow conditions. The presence of swirler (used to distribute the flow evenly in very low flow applications) above the SMA required more torque than is usual for the expected flow range. Without the correct amount of torque alignment the signal pulses from the SMA were degraded. CIDOIWELL/CLMNTS BP/ULA/A07/EOW 30 12 96MWD FAILURE No.3 At 4050m it became difficult to decode the signal and survey could not be obtained at TD. The signal strength had decreased from 3-6 to 0.5- psi and noise from the pumps, bit and turbine masking the signal was more apparent. At surface the pulser(SMA) was found to have stopped transmitting. It was possible to communicate with the tool on deck with the computer allowing retrieval of survey, temperature and gamma ray data from the memory. A computer test of the electronic cartridge at the well-site showed unstable values indicating an electronic problem. The SEA (electronic assembly) and SGR (gamma ray assembly) were returned to the Anadrill R&M centre for further analysis. The A-D values showed unstable, caused by ripple/noise from the DC-DC power supply failure. The temperature strips fitted to the tools indicated that the tools had been exposed to temperature of 166 C which is well above the rated temperature for the tool. MWD FAILURE No.4 The tool was set up for flow range between 90 to 150 gpm. It was not possible to pump more than 92 gpm at bottom, this is just above the lower threshold of the tool, resulting in weak signal and the string had to be pulled out of hole. At surface the tool was found to be working OK. Pulser configuration wrong due to not being able to pump the expected flow rate. C/DOWELLJCLIEN'TS BP/ULA/A07 LOW 30 12 96MWD FAILURE No.5 During the build-up section the signal was lost at 4070m, but tool was still working when pulled above this depth. At surface the tool was found to have reset, resulting in loss of memory data. Surface check on the rig showed unstable readings from the electronic cartridge Pulser unit showed sign of being mud invaded. The electronic assembly gamma ray and the pulser was sent to the &M base for further analysis. failure. Similar failure to No.3 The temperature strips fitted to the tools again indicated that the tools had been exposed to a temperature of 166 C which is well above the rated temperature for the tool. MWD FAILURE No.6 Due to pressure loss of 1200 psi at 4050m caused by sheared circulating sub the BHA had to be pulled out of hole. At surface the tool was not pulsing and no communication could be established with the tool. The FET saddle board in the SMA cartridge had failed due to beeing burnt. The temperature strips fitted to the tools showed that the tools had been exposed to minimum of 154 C. C/DOWELUCLIENTS/BP/ULA/A07/EOWMWD FAILURE No.7 Tool No : 095 When reaming from 4046m to 4085m the signal was to weak to decode and tool working intermittently. No survey could be obtained at TD. At surface the tool was not pulsing and no communication could be established with the tool. The FET saddle board in the SMA cartridge had failed due to being burnt. Similar failure as No.6.

Resistivity (to 3998m) indicates 1-2 ohm in the sands (compared to 4-8 ohm in 7/12-6 and AO2A). Assuming similar porosity sands, this would imply twice the water saturation in AO7A (i.e. 60% Sw). The PLT logged down to 3970 mBRT and the caliper indicated generally on gauge hole, but with washouts to 5-8 over intervals 3940-41 and 3950-54 mBRT. Spinner indicated most of the well inflow (1-2% oilcut from wellhead sampling) to be entering just below the 5 casing shoe (bad cement and/or coning down from Jurassic) with little or no flow from the Triassic. Interpretation Little or no Triassic flow could be due to:  Reservoir quality problem - low permeability ?  Reservoir pressure problem - Triassic at Jurassic pressure (or even lagging behind!) ? Prior to the flow period, the BHCIP was c. 6270 psi at 3900 mBRT (3450mss). The BHFP when the well was fully open was 5440 psi (3450 mss). Assuming PI of stb/d/psi (i.e. as measured in AO2A), one would expect an AO7A Triassic production rate of some 200 C /DOWELUCLIENTS BP/ULA/A07/EOW 30 12 96Schlumberger Oilfield Services bopd if the Triassic were at 6000 psi pressure and some 600 bopd if Triassic at original pressure. AO2A clearly indicated Triassic pressure to be above Jurassic pressure:  Well oilcut increased as the well was choked back (i.e. only high pressure Triassic producing)  WHCIP following shutin built up to Jurassic + oil column (Triassic influx displacing entire tubing to oil and displacing water back into the Jurassic) The possible situation of the AO7A Triassic being at (or below) current Jurassic pressure could be explained by the thinning of both the Bryne and Upper Triassic mudstone towards 7/12-6. In this scenario, AO2A being at original Triassic pressure can be explained by the mapped W-E trending fault between 7/12-6 and AO2A providing lateral barrier. The implication of this would be the potential for higher waterflood type recovery factors (c.25%) in the AO7A Triassic area (due to efficient waterflood sweep from the overlying Jurassic) if low BHFP can be achieved (requires Jurassic isolation at the production well) Dave Wilkinson 3 December 1996 CIDOWELUCLIENTS/BP/ULAJA07/LOW 30 12 969.0 Lessons learned: Coiled tubing equipment: The utilization of HR480 injectorhead for increased pulling capabilities has proved to be very beneficial. Especially when drilling the shoetrack and rathole. QT1000, 100.000psi yield coiled tubing provides significant increased pulling capabilities compared to psi yield coiled tubing 100.000 psi yield pipe is significantly more stiffer then psi yield pipe. Therefore 100 gooseneck is minimum required to lower the stresses on the gooseneck rollers, as well as the mounting pins to the injectorhead. The stiffer coiled tubing in combination with the gooseneck not 100% aligned caused problems with the weight indicator readings Permanent markings on the welds on the coiled tubing enhances the pipemanagement on location. High pressure cycling on welds can be more easily be avoided because the position of the weld can be visually seen. Regretfully the marking degrade fast, and disappear after four to five runs in the well. Supplier of coiled tubing are in the process improving the quality of permanent markings for coiled tubing. On the A07 operation the rig facilities were utilized as much as possible. Components used were: mudpits, pumps. Mudpump stroke counters do not provide the accuracy required when pumping small volumes. flow in- and flow out meter would improve the monitoring significantly. Also for wellcontrol when in overbalanced operation as planned for 7/12 A06. During deployment of the toolstrings long times were consumed performing pressure test on tree valves. Initially scale, valve integrity were indicated as main causes for repeated pressure test failures. After completion of A07 the tree was maintained and large amounts of sand and cement were found between the valves contributing to the failures Surface handling of bottomhole assemblies still consumes long periods of time and can be improved on. A bleed off / pump in sub between the swabvalve and the shear/seal BOP is desired to prevent That this connection has to be pressure tested through the tree. This has resulted in several incidents The flowline strainer performed again well in keeping large pieces of cuttings coming from the well entering the production facilities. C DOWELUCLIENTS/BP/ULA/A07 OW 30 296Bottomhole assemblies: The 3/8 turbodrill turbine proved to be suitable motor to drill in the Ula-environment. High ROP's and multiple runs with one motor. The Baker 1/8 navidrill with extended powersection and high temperature stator (F- rubber) also proved suited. The motor was used to drill out the shoetrack and rathole. The high torque (710 ft-lbs) was very beneficial in drilling, however the high stall torque caused quick connector to disconnect causing fishing operation. When the Baker motor is used for drilling or other applications other BHA components need to be carefully evaluated on torque rating. The trinity quick connector is good tool to improve time consumed making up bottomhole assemblies. The premature releasing of one of the quick connector has to be evaluated before the connector is re-used for coiled tubing operations. The bottomhole configuration for the build section performed as expected in build rate achieved. This was confirmed by multishot gyro. The high temperature in A07 caused problems with the SLIM1 MWD system to perform reliable. Operation: As for A02, A07 well preparation took significantly longer than expected because of well problems. This caused increased total costs to the project and delay of the start of the coiled tubing drilling. When installing the ID DHSV there was no spare DHSV or packing set available on the platform. Problems setting the DHSV are expected and spares should be readily available Drilling out the shoetrack and rathole, and the subsequent venturi runs were well planned and executed. Production stability remains problems when taking returns to the production facilities. Instabilities in the test separator caused high oil concentrations to sea at times. It appears the instability is worse with cement, than with the friction reducers. Hole cleaning did not present problems in A07. However the waterproduction from below the liner shoe significantly increased the annular velocity. The selection of mills and drillingbits performed as anticipated in the planning. Evaluation of the cores prior bit selections proved to be very beneficial. The SLIM1 MWD signals were easier to read when drilling with the turbine, compared when drilling with PDM. This could be related to less vibrations generated by the turbine Bottomhole assembly selection was good. CIDOWELLICLIENTSTMLA/A07/EOW 30 296In determining the potential oil production from the well while drilling samples were taken from the test separator. The samples were inconsistent and not representative for the actual production. Improvements can be made on the open hole logging performance, contingencies are required for when the tools can not get to bottom. The sonic did not perform due to the stand off being to hard. During logging problems were experienced with the integrity of the cable due to the high temperature. Coiled tubing depth gave meter depth discrepancy when compared with the logging data. The PLT gave useful information, especially on the quality of the cementsqueeze performed on the old perforations prior the coiled tubing drilling. The results showed the cementsqueeze was not effected by the drilling activities. The actual downhole temperatures were significantly higher then anticipated, contributing to the frequent MWD failures. To confirm the actual circulating temperatures during underbalance drilling using coiled tubing memory temperature sub was run on 7/12 A02 on 26/11/96. The operation was to drill out cement underbalanced with returns to the production facilities, being similar conditions as the A07 operation. Downhole temperatures in excess of 160C were seen on the tool confirming the MWD readings. Logistics: The limited availability of supply vessels and helicopters caused several problems during the operation. While performing these kind of operations there has to be more possibilities to load, or backload items to the platform at short notice. The right grapple for the overshot was not available when needed. It was stated on the original load out list but was not properly checked on-, and offshore. Scheduling of personnel was improved compared to the drilling on A02. However improvements can still be made. The crew was experienced and lot of teamwork was seen between the service companies. The introduction of supervisor on nights proved beneficial. Program/reporting: The quality of the drilling operation program was detailed and comprehensive. Programs on the well preparation should be closely checked with the drilling operation program to ensure all operations are covered. For A07 the production tubing pressure test was left out both programs. Improvements are needed on the issue of programs. It should be evaluated if all involved need complete operations manual, or if summary could be sufficient. C /DOWELL/CLIENTS BP/ULA/A07/EOW 30 12 96There was lot of double reporting between Dowell, Smedvig, Anadrill and Maritime. Before the next coiled tubing drilling operation this should be reviewed. By cutting down on the amount of reports more time is available for the possible introduction of 12 or 24 hour operation look ahead. The daily drilling report was distributed electronically which was very beneficial At all time the office team was able to retrieve the latest reports. Safety: Several supervisors were not aware of the dangers in the use of lithium batteries in high temperature wells. It is very important everybody is gone be made aware of the potential dangers. Operations were performed form the rigfloor providing safe working area for operations.

After pumping water without J313 (friction reducer) the prossure dropped to 3850 psi with bpm and it was possible to get data from the MWD tool. Drilling commenced with tool face of 70 tight for 1m and 45 right for further 2m before orienting to 25 right. Penetration rates of - 12 m/hr were achieved with occasional motor stalls. At 4070m survey was taken to get data from the end of the tangent section. At 4071m the signal was lost from the MWD tool but was re-gained when the bit was pulled above 4068m.The hole was drilled to 4088.5m while pulling off bottom periodically to check the tool face setting, assuming steady reactive torque of 30. survey was taken on bottom (stored in tool memory) and the assembly POOH.

Surveys were taken as required, usually every 10 meters. Toolface readings were available continuously while drilling. At TO of the well, multishot survey was run. Surveys were taken every 10m from the Tie- in point ti the kick off point and every 2m throughout the kick off. The actual well path is presented in the following pages. In section the definitive survey results are shown. All surveys are calculated using the Minimum Curvature Method.

This provided the real-time outputs needed for Directional Drilling and some data from the tool memory. Also available were interpretation programs for use either in real time or to be run off-line. In this well, Slim - MWD tools were used to measure the well- bore Direction and Inclination (D&I), together with toolface measurements. Gamma ray was measured throughout the extension of the well. The tool also transmitted temperature and shock recordings in real time to aid the drilling process. Certain surface data were measured and recorded to aid the MWD service. This data included depth, rate of penetration, and pump pressure. Both the downhole and surface data were collected and processed on the Slim IDEAL system. Two Anadrill MWD engineers were on location at all times. 2.2 DIRECTIONAL DRILLING SERVICES Anadrill provided the drilling tools required to directionally drill the 7/8 phase. These tools included all the required non- magnetic drill collars, float subs, cross overs, UBHO subs, Orienting tools and drilling connectors. Two A278M PowerPak high temperature motors were provided to kick off and drill the 3 7/8 hole sections. Two Directional Drilling Supervisors were on location at all times to plan, supervise and analyse the efficient drilling of usable well to the pre-determined target.2.3 ANADRILL PERSONNEL 2.3.1 MWD/SLIM Engineers Wilf Francis Ole Fossheim Cohn Lilley David Alan Harris 2.3.2 Directional Drilling Engineers Alf Lindgren Don Deeney Paul Winterbottom John Finn 2.3.3 Field Service Manager lain Gordon3.1 OPEN HOLE RECORD HOLE SIZE FROM TO 6 3892m 3904m 3 7/8 3904m 4088.5m 3.2 CASING RECORD CASING SIZE FROM TO Preset liner 3128m 3758m Preset liner 3538m 3892mAnadrill Schlumberger Ula 7112-A07A-CTD 4.1 DRILLING SECTION SUMMARY 3 7/8 Drilling Phase: The 7/8 drilling phase started at depth of 3904m and finished at total depth of 4088.5m. After changing out the DHSV and rigging up the coil tubing equipment on well 7/12- AO7A-CTD, an inflatable packer was run in hole in order to test the integrity of the production tubing. The packer hung up in the DHSV on the first run and slight re- arranging of the BHA was needed. The liner tested good at 3800 psi. venturi junk- basket run was then performed in order to clean up the well prior to drilling out the cement and shoetrack. BHA #4 was made up and run in hole. The BHA consisted of straight 1/8 BHI Navidrill motor and Red Baron TCI impregnated bullnose mill. Bottom was tagged at 3881m and milling started. At 3886.9m, the motor stalled out and while picking off bottom an overpull of 12 klbs was seen and the jars fired. When back on bottom, no progress was seen and it was decided to pull out of the hole. When out of the hole, it was found that most of the BHA was left in the hole. The top Trinity Quick Connect tool had parted. A fishing run including an overshot was performed and the fish was latched and pulled out of the hole on the first attempt. The BHI Navidrill was changed out for new one, and BHA # was run in hole to continue to mill cement and the liner shoe. The shoe was milled from 3886.9m to 3887.5m with an average ROP of m/hr. After reaming the shoe area, the rathole was drilled to 3897.5m, with an average ROP of m/hr, where new formation was encouted. Two meters of new formation were drilled to 3899.4m prior to pulling out of the hole due to cuttings plugging the production seperator lines. The same mill and BHI Navidrill motor were run in the hole to continue to mill new formation. When running in hole, fill was tagged at 3893.4m, and milled to 3901.8m in 5.5 hrs. At 3901.8m, the hole packed off and the string got stuck. Slow circulation at bpm with 4000 psi was possible. The string was freed by pulling 70 klbs overpull, but the jars did not work. After checking that the same pump pressure was obtained after the incident, the well was observed prior to pulling out of the hole. venturi junk basket was then run in order to clean up the rathole prior to running the turbine. BHA # was then run in the hole, incorporating an Neyfor T2 Turbine and Smith D72HT diamond bit with 10 gauge and the Slim-1 MWD. The shoe and rathole was carefully reamed to bottom. After bedding the bit in, drilling continued with an average controlled ROP of 5m/hr. Whilst attempting to take survey at 3914m, the MWD stopped transmitting data. Drilling continued to 3936.7m, where the BHA was pulled in order to change out the MWD tool. The bit and MWD was changed, but during shallow hole testing, the MWD again failed. The string was pulled to surface and the MWD checked and changed. BHA #11 was then run in hole, and drilling resumed. Good ROP was seen throughout the majority of the run, averaging m/hr. Drilling continued to 4057m. The last two surveys was difficult to get from the MWD, but using the cement pumps improved the MWD signals. At this point the bit was pulled out of the hole in order to perform open hole wireline logging prior to kicking off the well to horizontal.Before running the logging string, 1/2 fluted drift was run to check that the tools could be run to bottom. As it was not possible to pass 3947.5m the wireline was POOH and coil tubing rigged up again to make clean up run with the turbine. BHA #12 was run in hole and tagged obstruction at 3941m with klbs. This spot was reamed and while running in to TD, occasional other tight spots were reamed. The string was then backreamed out of the hole and the interval from 3941m to 3952m was reamed several times prior to coming out of the hole. Wireline E-logs were then run, but failed at 3100m. However, it was decided to run in the hole to check for tight spots. The logging string was unable to pass 3948m. second logging configuration was then run, Having abandoned the logging, drilling assembly was run to start the build section at 35 / 30m from 4057m. The assembly consisted of Hycalog diamond bit and 7/8 PowerPak motor with the adjustable bent housing set to 2.6. This assembly also hung up at 3947m and it was necessary to cycle the orienting tool several times to orient the bend in position to allow the assembly to pass through. On bottom pump pressures were significantly higher than expected and it was not possible to pump sufficient fluid for the MWD tool to generate readable signal. Consequently the assembly was POOH to change the MWD pulsar configuration. The Rotor by-pass nozzle in the motor was also reduced to accommodate the lower flow rate. An identical assembly, but with new motor and MWD, was run in the hole and at bottom pump pressures were found to be psi higher than the previous run. Again flow was too low for readable MWD signal to be generated. It was suspected that too high concentration of J313 (friction reducer) was present in the sea water and that this could be producing skin which would increase pressure losses. The coil and hole was circulated with water without J313 and the pressure dropped sufficiently for the flow to be increased to bbls and the MWD to operate normally. New hole was drilled using the MWD tool face readings to steer the assembly down to 4071m where the tool stopped transmitting. On pulling back to 4068m the tool restarted transmitting. It was assumed that lack of signal was due to the pulsar jamming against the flow sleeve as the tool entered section of hole with higher dog leg. The hole was drilled down to 4088.5m without real time tool face readings although the assembly was occasionally pulled back to the section above 4070m to check the tool face orientation. The assembly was then POOH as no survey could be transmitted with the intention of downloading the surveys from the tool memory to evaluate the situation. However, on surface the tool memory was found to have failed. The same assembly was run again but with the motor bend reduced to degrees based on the assumption that an excessive dogleg had been created with the previous assembly. The intention was to survey the build section in tool memory and drill on building angle at lower dogleg in the hope that the tool pulsar would again be able to function. Whilst orienting the tool face at 4050m sudden pump pressure rise occurred and the pop-off on the pump blew. The resultant water hammer effect actuated the down hole circulating sub resulting in 1200 psi pressure drop and another trip out of the hole. On surface the bit jets were found to be plugged with rubber from the from the motor stator. Large quantities of rubbery flakes (assumed to be solidified J313) were found on all components of the BHA especially on top of the motor and MWD. The coil was pigged twice and further large quantities of this material were flushed out. The MWD tool was found to have failed and it was not possible to download the survey from it. The final attempt to survey/drill the hole consisted of the same assembly which was run to bottom only to find the MWD tool had again failed. This was POOH and the project abandoned as there were no more SLIM MWD tools available and no other alternative could be found to work in the 150 degree temperatures down hole.A magnetic multi shot, rated to 252C, was run inside the non magnetic drill collars with Hycalog diamond bit and straight motor, to survey the hole to TD. The assembly was run in the hole pumping at bpm and hung up at 3910m. Several attempts were made to get past the obstruction and with bpm flow no differential pressure was observed from the motor when 15,000 lb. were set down. Not having the facility to orient the BHA and to avoid damaging the survey tool it was decided to POOH to pick up bent housing motor and orienting tool. On the next run with the survey tool the motor was set to 1.83 and the upper NMDC was replaced with the orienting tool. Again the assembly hung up at 3910m but having rotated the motor bend through 180 the assembly broke through and was run to bottom. The preferred option was to survey from bottom to top without pumping and with the well shut in. However, the over pull was too high to accomplish this and it was necessary to pump at bpm while flowing the well with 25% choke. The well was surveyed at 2m intervals from 4086m to 4060m and every 10m from then to the shoe. Good results were obtained and the operation was suspended. Recommendations: To avoid severe damage to the bit gauge it is recommended that the flow would not exceed bpm while running in the hole with turbine. Evidence of junk was observed from the rat hole beneath the casing shoe and coupled with the possibility of hard cement being present it is recommended that reaming this section be avoided. It is recommended that all motor assemblies run through deviated hole have the facility to orient to pass any obstructions. This would necessitate bent housing and orienting tool to avoid the problems seen in run 17. C4.2 MWD SECTION SUMMARY The 7/8 phase was drilled in Slim MWD run which used Slim-1 MWD tool providing D&I, Gravity Toolface and Gamma Ray. The well was drilled to TD of 4088m. The temperature in this well was recorded up to 166 . C, the limit for Slim-1 MWD is 150 . The high temperature seemed to be the main problem in this well, causing the electronic in the tool to fail.5.0 MWD RUN DETAILSMWD RUN No. BHA No. Depth in : Pumping hours : 21 Depth out : Operating hours : 15 Drilled : % operating : 71 Tool No : 462 Bit to Survey depth :19.44 Collar No. : 001/002/013 Bit to Gamma Ray :16.72 Sensor Failure : Yes WOB : Klb Flow rate : 70 - 90 gpm RPM : N/A Inclination : -  COMMENTS: The Slim-1 tool was included in the string to provide surveys and gamma ray. The tool worked well down to 3914m with signal strength of 3-6 psi. At 3914m the string was back- reamed prior to taking survey and the real-time signal was lost. Several attempts were made to restart the tool by cycling the pumps and varying the flow rate, with no success. It was decided to drill on another 20 meters before pulling out of hole. At the surface the pulser(SMA) was found to have stopped and it was not possible to communicate with the tool from the computer. The electronic cartridge (SEA) and gamma ray cartridge (SGR) were sent back to town for further analysis. At the R&M facility it was found that condenser in the SGR had failed causing the fuse to blow in one of the batteries. The tool recorded downhole temperatures of 154 . and some shocks whilst drilling. complete failure report is given in the MWD failure report section.Anadrill Schlumberger Ula 7112-A07A-CTD MWD RUN No. Depth in : Depth out : Drilled :Om Tool No : 337 WOB : N/A RPM : N/A BHA No. 10 Pumping hours Operating hours % operating Bit to Survey depth Bit to Gamma Ray Sensor Failure Flow rate Inclination : :19.44 :16.72 : Transmission : 70 - 90 gpm :  A complete new Slim-1 MWD tool was picked up for this run. At 670m the shallow hole test was performed which gave signal strength of 1-2 psi. Our judgement was that this would not be sufficiently strong signal to ensure good decoding whilst drilling and that it was possible to achieve better signal by adjusting the tool at surface. Consequently the string was pulled out of hole. On the surface the tool was found to be functioning normally for the way it had been configured. The weak signal was caused by torque setting to the pulser (SMA) which proved to be inappropriate to the prevailing flow conditions. See MWD failure report section for details.Anadrill Schlumberger Ula 7/12-A07A-CTD MWD RUN No. BHA No. 11 Depth in : Pumping hours : 41 Depth out : 4057 Operating hours : 38 Drilled : % operating : Tool No : 337 Bit to Survey depth :19.44 Sensor Failure : Transmission The MWD tool from the previous run was checked and pulser(SMA) with different alignment torque installed in the tool. The shallow hole test was performed at surface this time and gave an signal strength of 3-6 psi. A usable signal was obtained down to 4030m when severe problems in getting survey were experienced. reliable survey was obtained by switching from the rig pumps to Dowell cement pump which gave better quality of signal. Drilling continued with real-time signal to 4050m where great difficulty was found in attempting to decode the signal and no further surveys could be obtained. Drilling continued to TD. at 4057m before pulling out of hole. Transverse shocks of 1-10 and temperatures in excess of 150 . Centigrade were seen in real time throughout the run. On surface the tool was found to have stopped transmitting but would communicate with the computer allowing memory data to be obtained. Dumping the tool memory gave the necessary survey information from TD, and also showed recorded bottom hole temperature of over 158 . Centigrade. The tool was returned to Base for failure analysis, the findings are given in MWD failure report 3.MWD RUN No. BHA No. 12 Depth in : 4057 Pumping hours : 11 Depth out : 4057 Operating hours : 11 Drilled : % operating : 100 Tool No : 227 Bit to Survey depth : Collar No. : 001/002/013 Bit to Gamma Ray : Sensor Failure : N/A WOB : N/A Flow rate : 90 gpm RPM : N/A Inclination :  The pulser was configured for flow range from 90 to 150 gpm, based on expected flow of 120-130 gpm. At bottom it became clear that the maximum flow would be 92 gpm, this was just above the lower threshold of the flow range for this configuration. Due to the weak signal the BHA had to be pulled to surface to change the pulser configuration. At surface the tool was found to work OK.Depth in : 4057 Depth out : 4088 Drilled : 31 Tool No : 227 BHA No. 13 : 28 : 26 : 100 : 11.6m Flow rate : 90 gpm Inclination :  The Slim-1 pulser was configured back to flow range of 70-100 gpm, giving signal strength up to 16 psi at 105 gpm. During the build-up section the MWD signal was lost at 4070m, probably due to exceeding the dogleg capability of the tool. Pulling back past 4070m the MWD was still working. Without surveys it was not possible to continue drilling and the coil had to be pulled out of hole. At surface the tool was found to have reset, resulting in the memory data to be lost.MWD RUN No. BHA No. 14 Depth in : 4088 Pumping hours : 11 Depth out : 4088 Operating hours : 11 Drilled :Om % operating : 100 Tool No : 069 Bit to Survey depth : 11.6m Sensor Failure : SEA The Slim-1 tool was changed leaving out the gamma ray assembly. The coil was run in the hole to 4050m, at this point sudden pressure increase caused the mud pump pop offs to blow. Once circulation was restarted pressure loss of 1200 psi was seen due to the circulating sub shearing. At surface the bit was found to be plugged with rubber from the motor. The electronics of the Slim tool was found to have failed as the tool was not operational at surface and no communication with the tool could be established.Depth in : 4088 Tool No : 095 BHA No. 15 : SEA : 90 gpm The Slim-1 electronic was changed out from the previous run. Took weight at 4046m and the hole was reamed down to 4085m. During the reaming the tool signal was very weak and intermittent , probably due to the high dog-leg. No survey could be obtained at TD. At surface the tool was found to have stopped transmitting and it was not possible to establish communication. See failure report for further details.6.0 FAILURE REPORTSMWD FAILURE No.! RUN No. Tool No : 227 FAILURE DESCRIPTION. At 3914m the signal was lost when back reaming prior to taking survey. Attempts were made to restart the tool by cycling the pumps and changing flow rates, with no success. Transverse shock from 1-10 was seen throughout the run and occasionally shock values of 11-20. At surface the tool was found to have stopped and it was not possible to communicate with the tool. The battery section was found to be giving volts. FAILURE ANALYSIS. The Slim-1 electronic section and gamma ray section were returned to the Anadrill & M facility for further analysis. It was found that leaking condenser in the gamma ray assembly led to short in the high voltage circuit causing the fuse in one of the batteries to blow. Temperature strips are fitted to all our MWD tools and these recorded maximum temperature of 154  C. This is slightly in excess of the rated temperature limit for the tool which is 150  C. degree of shock combined with the high temperatures is the probable cause of failure.Anadrill Schlumberger Ula 7112-A07A-CTD c MWD FAILURE No.2 RUN No. : The shallow hole test was performed at 670m giving signal of only 1-2 psi. The signal strength could not be improved by varying the flow rates and it was judged best to pull out of hole and make adjustments to the pulser(SMA) to obtain better signal and ensure fully-decoded signal whilst drilling. The alignment toque set on the pulser(SMA) was incorrect for these flow conditions. The presence of swirler (used to distribute the flow evenly in very low flow applications) above the SMA required more torque than is usual for the expected flow range. Without the correct amount of torque alignment the signal pulses from the SMA were degraded.MWD FAILURE No.3 : 337 At 4050m it became difficult to decode the signal and survey could not be obtained at TD. The signal strength had decreased from 3-6 to 0.5- psi and noise from the pumps, bit and turbine masking the signal was more apparent. At surface the pulser(SMA) was found to have stopped transmitting. It was possible to communicate with the tool on deck with the computer allowing retrieval of survey, temperature and gamma ray data from the memory. A computer test of the electronic cartridge at the well-site showed unstable values indicating an electronic problem. The SEA (electronic assembly) and SGR (gamma ray assembly) were returned to the Anadrill R&M centre for further analysis. The A-D values showed unstable, caused by ripple/noise from the DC-DC power supply failure. The temperature strips fitted to the tools indicated that the tools had been exposed to temperature of 166 degrees Centigrade which is well above the rated temperature for the tool.MWD FAILURE No.4 The tool was set up for flow range between 90 to 150 gpm. It was not possible to pump more than 92 gpm at bottom, this is just above the lower threshold of the tool, resulting in weak signal and the string had to be pulled out of hole. At surface the tool was found to be working OK. Pulser configuration wrong due to not being able to pump the expected flow rate.MVVD FAILURE No.5 During the build-up section the signal was lost at 4070m, but tool was still working when pulled above this depth. At surface the tool was found to have reset, resulting in loss of memory data. Surface check on the rig showed unstable readings from the electronic cartridge. Pulser unit showed sign of being mud invaded. The electronic assembly, gamma ray and the pulser was sent to the &M base for further analysis. supply failure. Similar failure to No.3 The temperature strips fitted to the tools again indicated that the tools had been exposed to temperature of 166 degrees Centigrade which is well above the rated temperature for the tool.MWD FAILURE No.6 : 069 Due to pressure loss of 1200 psi at 4050m caused by sheared circulating sub the BHA had to be pulled out of hole. At surface the tool was not pulsing and no communication could be established with the tool. The FET saddle board in the SMA cartridge had failed due to beeing burnt. The temperature strips fitted to the tools showed that the tools had been exposed to minimum of 154 degrees Centigrade.MWD FAILURE No.7 : 095 When reaming from 4046m to 4085m the signal was to weak to decode and tool working intermittently. No survey could be obtained at TD. At surface the tool was not pulsing and no communication could be established with the tool. The PET saddle board in the SMA cartridge had failed due to beeing burnt. Similar failure as No.6.7.0 BOTTOM HOLE ASSEMBLIES.  . . . . Schlumberger Bottom Hole Assembly Report  .

After several attempts to pass through the orienting tool was cycled several times to change tool face, eventually allowing assembly to pass. The BHA was then reamed to bottom through another tight spot at 4048m. Due to pressure restrictions it was not possible to pump sufficient fluid to allow readable MWD signal to be generated and after further reaming/backreaming the assembly was POOH. 2 7/8 PowerPak A/S 1024 3/8 RB 3/8 RB ABH / Nozzle X/0 Sub A/S AB-025 055 Px 3/8 RB Orienting Tool A/S 016 3/8 RPx 3/8 RB 14 Nozzle Jar D/S 2360 3/8 RPx 3/8 RB Hydraulic Non Rotating Joint D/S 026 NRJ 1/16 SA c-Schlumberger Bottom Hole Assembly Report  Company; Br.

OBJECTIVE: Kick off well with 35 deg/30m dogleg to horizontal. Correct azimuth to 315-325 degrees. . . RESULTS: Initialy pump pressures were 3-400 psi higher than previous run, restricting the flowrate. After pumping water without J313 (friction reducer) the prossure dropped to 3850 psi with bpm and it was possible to get data from the MWD tool. Drilling commenced with tool face of 70 right for lm and 45 right for further 2m before orienting to 25 right. Penetration rates of - 12 m/hr were achieved with occasional motor stalls. At 4070m survey was taken to get data from the end of the tangent section. At 4071m the signal was lost from the MWD tool but was re-gained when the bit was pulled above 4068m.The hole was drilled to 4088.5m while pulling off bottom periodically to check the tool face setting, assuming steady reactive torque of 30. survey was taken on bottom (stored in tool memory) and the assembly POOH. Due to failure of the tool memory no survey was retrieved on surface. 2 7/8 PowerPak A/S 1023 3/8 RB 3/8 ABH / Nozzle UBHO A/S AA-019 3/8 RP xV 055 Disconnect D/S 018 1/16 SAP xB 7/8 Ball @ 3000 psi.

OBJECTIVE: Collect surveys in MWD memory over build up section. Drill further 25m with lower dog- leg until MWD in new hole where transmission of signal may be achieved. If so continue build up to horizontal and correct azimuth as required.  RESULTS: Whilst orienting tool face at 4050m pop-offs blew following instantaneous pressure rise. On resuming pumping 1200 psi reduction in pressure was noted. This was assumed to be due to activation of the downhole circulation sub and the assembly was POOH to check. The bit jets were found to be plugged with rubber from the motor stator and the circulating sub was,as expected in the open position. 2 7/8 PowerPak A/S 01039 3/8 3/8 1.83 ABH / No Nozzle Dual Flapper Valves D/S 018 1/16 SA NRJSchlumberger Bottom Hole Assembly Report  - Company: BP Norge UA  .

Surveys were taken as required, usually every 10 meters. Toolface readings were available continuously while drilling. At TD of the well, multishot survey was run. Surveys were taken every 10m from the Tie-in point ti the kick off point and every 2m throughout the kick off. The actual well path is presented in the following pages. In section the definitive survey results are shown. All surveys are calculated using the Minimum Curvature Method.BP NORGE IJA Sc.hlurnberger Anadrill [rue Vertical 3495   3555  3585  3615  .3645  .3675  3705  3735  13f)r, Structure : ULA  Field :ULA Well : A078 Location :North Sea (Norwegian Shelf) Tie on Scale : > -1450 -1 -1 I A078-COD AO7B Schlumberger  900  100 LIIJON => 00'SZ : aion  WELL DATA     reoted by .
