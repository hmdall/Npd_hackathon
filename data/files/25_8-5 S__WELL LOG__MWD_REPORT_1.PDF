Several problems were encountered in this section, which will be discussed below. 1. Problems with drilling out the wiper plug. We were not successful in drilling out the wiper plug in the 13 3/8 casing. The indications on surface suggested faulty motor, very little differential pressure was achieved across the motor. At surface, the motor was tested, and the dump valve did not close properly at 680 gpm flow. During this test the SPP was only 50 psi (motor tested alone). The motor was laid out and new motor picked up and tested at 770 gpm / 600 psi (motor and MWD). This motor had the same problems initially with drilling the wiper plug. Spudding the bit on the plug solved the problem. Nothing was wrong with the motor, when it was serviced (see report in section 8), and we believe that the flow when testing the motor after the run was not 680 gpm, as indicated. Very little time was spent testing the motor after the perceived problem, hence no firm conclusions could be made on the rig. 2. Problems with drilling oriented. Drilling oriented was easy to start with, then became increasingly difficult. It was impossible to hold toolface orientation. Pulled out the PDC bit and picked up rock bit. With the rock bit oriented drilling was possible, but very slow (2 in/hr). Tried with different PDC bit. Again, there were severe problems with holding the toolface orientation, which lead to lower build rates than what the assembly was capable of. Increased the number of drill collars in the assembly and ran rock bit, but again the ROP was very low, both rotating and orienting. At this point it was decided to set casing early and lower the mudweight in the 1/2 hole. Three areas of concern are: - Mudweight: We believe the high overbalance caused the very low ROP when drilling oriented with rock bit. The overbalance was recommended, however, to minimize wellbore stability related problems. In future wells it should be considered to increase the overbalance only as hole conditions dictate, rather than as per program.- Drill collars: There were too few drill collars in the assemblies for drilling with PDC bit. The assembly provided too little torsional support to enable holding toolface orientation. Using HWDP instead of DC's (at low inclination) is possible in soft formations, and did work well at the start of the section. However, deeper down the torque generated from the bit was too erratic for this type of assembly, mainly due to firmer formations / hard stringers and possibly also due to the overbalance (cuttings not effectively removed from the bottom of the hole). - Directional proposal: By moving the rig further away from target 1, all the directional work could have been completed in the Hordaland Group, probably without the problems experienced when drilling this well. However, we think that the problems were caused by the two former points (mud weight and drill collars), and hence these should be adressed in future wells. Conclusions / recommendations: 1. Consider drilling with lower overbalance, then increase mud weight as hole conditions dictate. 2. Do not replace DC's with HWDP in low angle wells, as HWDP do not provide enough torsional support.8 1/2 SECTION: Due to the problems in the 12 1/4 section, the directional plan had to be completed in the 1/2 section. One motor failure occured in this section; small wash-out was discovered at surface while testing the motor. report is found in section 8. There were problems with building angle in this section, through the Heimdal and Cretaceous Formations. All assemblies were designed to build in rotary, but actually dropped. One rotary assembly, BHA # 21, had to be pulled out due to excessive building tendency, 0.9/30m. The previous rotary assembly, BHA # 19 (BHA # 20 was coring assembly), was identical from directional behaviour point of view and dropped 0.9/30m. This change of behaviour is explained by change of formation, from Cretaceous to Jurassic. - The dropping tendency of the Heimdal and Cretaceous Formations must be accounted for when designing BHNs in future wells. - The high flow rate may have had bad effect on the BHA's performance, i.e. caused some of the problems with building angle. If this is the case, hole wash-out should be evident on the caliper log, if run.sperripsun DRILLING SERVICES SDDE - Directional Drilling Database WELL: 25/8-5S BHA #: TALLY FIELD/WELL: Esso BHA: # Steerable HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT DESCRIPTION 25/8-5S motor assembly WEIGHT LENGTH (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB 5TH (m) STB GAUGE (in)___ x/o (on motor) 30 x/o 51847 120 8 FLOAT 200 CDR 1447 IL STAB 314 MWD 1891 PRS 152 Totco 8 NMDC 4000 8 DC 2110 X/0 110 5 HWDP 12 8322 6 1/2 JARS 1900 5 HWDP 4160 WEIGHTS_________in air (kgm) in mud (mt) with 10 % safety (mt) ABOVE JAR 4160 ..\sdderpts\bha_t101.rpt 20/Sep/94sperry- sun BHA #: - COMMENTS This assembly was to drill first drill out the cement, then continue with drilling the kick-off. While attempting to drill out the cement and wiper plug, no differential or torque could be obtained. Various drilling parameters were tried to get the assembly to drill. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and the assembly was pooh. On reaching surface the motor was tested, and the dump valve appeared not to be functioning correctly.

After much perseverance, and varying of the drilling parameters we eventually managed to drill the plug, and continue drilling out the casing. metres of new formation were drilled, and PIT or FIT test was performed to the equivalent of ppg mud. Drilling then continued, the first build and hold at degrees was completed without any serious problems, the build rate being in the order of degrees per 30 metres. Though this was obtained mostly from short sets. The main kick-off proved to be more troublesome. At first steering was not problem though rather erratic BHA performance was noted. The dogleg capabilty ranged from to degrees per 30 metres. The assembly was also building in rotary mode up to degrees per 30 metres. Steering got progressively more difficult, in the sense of uncontrollable and erratic toolfaces. Hanging up was not seen as problem. The MWD surveys also showed some odd results, with the azimuth showing a jump from 163 to 171 degrees, even though we were steering left to highside. The magnetics were out of range, and this was thought to be due to pyrites in the formation. trip for rock bit, and new MWD was then performed. .Asdde\rpts\bha_c101.rpt 30/Sep/94Sperry- sun BHA #: - TALLY FIELD/WELL: Esso BHA: # Steerable HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT DESCRIPTION 25/8-5S motor assembly (rock bit) WEIGHT LENGTH DC OD (kgm) (m) (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB STB (m) STB GAUGE (in)___ ..1.sdde\rptstha_t101.rptThis run was characterised by low rop, and low motor differential. Sliding was possible but was very slow, sometimes as low as metres per hour. It was easy to hold steady toolfaces, but at such low rop the performance was not at the maximum for this assembly. The build rate in steering mode was about 3 degrees per 30 metres, and in rotary mode it held angle. The torque was more erratic while rotating, and the string stalled out several times. As we were not obtaining sufficient build and turn, it was looking like we would only just reach the target. trip for slick assembly, and different bit was suggested, but it was decided to rotate to coring point. The core point at hopefully the top of the Heimdal formation was reached and it was decided to pooh for the coring assembly. The bit grade showed that the bit was prehaps, not the most suitable choice, considering the low rop. ..sdde\rpts\bha_c101.rpt 20/Sep/94spernp sun DRILLIRIS SERVICES BHA #: 10 - TALLY FIELD/WELL: Esso 25/8-5S BHA: # 10 Steerable motor assembly HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT WEIGHT LENGTH DESCRIPTION (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT CB STB (m) TO STB GAUGE (in)__ 5 HWDP 18 12483 ..kedde\rpts\bha_t101.rpt 20/Sep/94BHA #: 10 - COMMENTS This assembly was characterised again by poor performance directionally, and by low rop. Inability to keep steady toolfaces caused, the assembly to produce doglegs of only - degrees, which falls short of what the assembly is capable of, and what was required to follow the proposal. Getting the assembly to turn was particularly difficult. Eventually it was decided that we needed to improve this overall performance and pooh to change the assembly. It was suggested that we run with some drill collars, without the stabiliser on the MWD, and with an insert bit It is of interest to note that the stabiliser on the MWD was quite badly worn, and much of the hardfacing had come away. ..\sdderpts\bha_c101.rpt 20/Sep/94WELL: 2518-5S BHA #: 11 TALLY BHA: # 11 Steerable assembly HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT WEIGHT LENGTH DESCRIPTION (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB 5Th (m) STB GAUGE xio (on motor) 30 8DC 6330 5 HWDP 12 7628 ..\sdde\rptstha_t101.rptBHA #: 11 - COMMENTS This run did not improve the drilling or directional performance. Once on bottom it was quickly clear that sliding was still problem. We could not get weight to the bit and progress was painfully slow. Even in rotary rop did not improve significantly. The Mwd stopped working, and also due to our sliding problems it was decided to pooh. It was then decided to log and set casing early. The problems we were having sliding were deemed to be caused by drilling overbalance, and that after setting casing, the mud weight could be lowered by as much as 2 ppg, which hopefully would improve our performance. ..tdderptstiha_c101.rpt 20/Sep/94BHA #: 15 - TALLY FIELD/WELL: 25/8-5S BHA: #15 STEERABLE MOTOR ASSY HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT WEIGHT LENGTH DESCRIPTION (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB STB (m) STB GAUGE (in)__ (MOTOR SLV 37890) CDR 1364 WOB/TORQUE SUB 150 MWD 1364 TOTCO NMDC 1295 8 DCs 10314 12xHWDP 8330 JARS 1300 6xHWDP 4165 ABOVE JAR 4165 ..\sdderptstha_t101.rptsperry-sun BHA #: 15 COMMENTS This assembly was used to drill out the cement, and shoe, and no problems were encountered during this operation. Once drilling is was noticable how easy drilling in oriented mode was, compared to previously. The dogleg for this assembly was quite high so we were carefull not to do too much continuous steering. Though initially the MWD was showing that we were not getting anywhere like the full potential from the assembly. We drilled bearing this in mind, and steered for longer intervals than initially expected. The MWD azimuth was then found to be very erratic, and several surveys had to be taken at each point. Finally rotational cluster shot was taken, and spread of degrees in azimuth was produced, which is out of specification for the Anadrill tool. The Anadrill Engineer then put the surveys through some software to correct for magnetic interference along the axis of the magnetometers. The results produced more sensible values for the azimuths, though as we had drilled on the information from the initial surveys we now had degree dogleg in the hole. We continued drilling and were getting the turn, and build. It was then decided to rotate one stand, which should have built about degrees. Unfortunately the assembly dropped about - degrees, and walked to the right. At this point the rop also dropped dramatically, so much that the decision to pull out of hole was taken. ..\sdderptsbha_c101.rpt 20/Sep/94BHA #: 16 - TALLY BHA: #16 Steerable motor HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT DESCRIPTION assembly WEIGHT LENGTH (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB STB (m) STB GAUGE (in)_ EHP 51 LH6781 25 FLOAT SUB 108 MWD 1530 7 DCs 9025 121cHWDP 8330 ..\sdde\rpts\bha_t101.rpt 20/Sep/94BHA #: 16 - COMMENTS This run was very short lived due to an MWD failure.

The MWD was again checked by doing set of cluster shots, the resulting azimuth at 2456 metres was degrees, as apposed to on the previous run. Though the quality of the survey was much better on this run. Generally the surveys were more consistant, and stable on this run. Steering commenced, and it was quickly apparent that we were only getting 2 - degrees per 30 metres as apposed to - degrees that the assembly is capable of. However the formation firmed up slightly and at 2570 metres we obtainned degree dogleg, so we reduced the amount of steering. At 2600 metres we drilled into the cretaceous chalk, and the rop dropped significantly. Shortly after the Bha's performance became inconsistant, and a drop occurred even after steering 10 metres at 30 left. It also dropped 1.5 degrees in rotary. So we soon found ourselves well below the line, drilling with an unpredictable assembly. We perservered, though at most we got only degrees per 30 metres out of the assembly even with continuous steering. The decision was then made to pooh and change the assembly to more conventional but more aggressive one, so we could limit steering, and hopefully build or at least hold in rotary. ..\sdde\rpts\bha_c101.rpt 20/Sep/94BHA #: 18 - TALLY FIELD/WELL: Esso 25/8-5S BHA: #18 HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT DESCRIPTION WEIGHT LENGTH (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB STB (m) STB GAUGE (in)____ 7 3/4 STAB 51155 150BHA #: 18 COMMENTS This assembly had to be reamed/washed to bottom from 2383 metres to TD. From 2383 to 2388 metres it was tight. We commenced steering as soon as we started drilling and drilled to 2758 metres, when pressure loss in the yellow pod of the BOP necessitated trip to the shoe, while the pod was pulled and repaired. The assembly was backreamed to the shoe. Once the pod was repaired we ran to bottom, having to ream/wash from 2411 metres. Once on bottom we commenced steering, and soon found the assembly only producing - degrees doglegs per 30 metres. This meant we had to steer up to three joints per stand, to get the turn and build. As we had to steer more than expected hole cleaning started to become somewhat of problem, so we pumped lo-vis/hi-vis pill everytime we rotated. This seemed to improve hole cleaning. At 2914 metres we rotated ahead, as we knew we were in the target. The assembly dropped at degrees per stand when rotating. The geologists were still having problems indentifying the point we would core. The string stalled, and the downhole torque steadily dropped. At this time the downhole noise also increased, and the DD Supervisor recommended pulling the bit. It was then decided to pooh and check the bit, and also change to rotary assembly, to drill to core point. This would enable the gamma and resistivity sensors to be nearer the bit. It would also enable us to run stiffer assembly, before running the core barrel. On reaching surface the bit showed severe wear, with one cone very slack. The bit was pulled just in time. ..1sdde\rptstha_c101.rptDRILLING SERVICES SDDE - Directional Drilling Database WELL: 25/8-5S BHA #: 19 - TALLY BHA: #19 Rotary hold assembly HOLE SIZE: COMPONENT WEIGHT LENGTH DESCRIPTION (kgm) (m) DC OD (in) DC ID (in) BIT TO CB 5Th (m) STB GAUGE (in)__ 8 1/2 NB 12056 150 ..\sdde\rpts\bha t101.rpt 20/Sep/94sperry- sun BHA #: 19 - COMMENTS Made up packed rotary build assembly to drill to coring point.

Norway, Dyvi Stena 25/8-5S NR-DD-94067 30/07/94 - 30/07/94 1. Motor Configuration: Adjustable bent housing set at 1.15, 5:6 lobe configuration. 2. Job application: Run with 12 1/4 PDC bit to drill out cement and wiper plug. 3. Operating parameters: Attempted to drill wiper plug for hours. 4. Downhole Problem Perception: Assembly would not drill the cement, motor differential pressure of only 50 psi was obtainable. 5. Downhole Corrective Action / Results: Various combinations of WOB, RPM and flow rates used without success. 6. Surface Observations / Tests: Dump sub not operating correctly and fluid porting to the annulus when pumping at 680 gpm. Not permitted to test motor without dump sub. 7. Workshop Observations / Tests (prior to disassembly): No indications of any malfunctions noted prior to disassembly of the motor. (Dump sub manually tested).8. Disassembly and Inspection Details: Upon disassembly of the motor, the dump sub was inspected and tested and found to be in good working order. Upon disassembly of the dump sub, no indications of any damage were observed. The 0-ring seals were found to be in good condition and correctly seated. The spring length was measured and found to be compared to the minimum requirement of 8. No foreign bodies or obstructions were observed which could have impeded movement of the piston. All surfaces were found to be in good condition with no corrosion evident. 9. Conclusions: The dump sub is relatively simple assembly, basically consisting of sliding piston and spring arrangement. With no flow, the spring holds the piston in the open position, allowing the drilling fluid to vent to the annulus through ports. The pressure of the circulating fluid drives the piston down against the spring closing off these ports such that all the fluid passes through the motor. When the motor was tested on surface, the dump sub was found to be inoperable, i.e. the piston did not move down when circulating at an indicated flow rate of 680 gpm. It should be noted that the flow rate required to close the valve is lower than the specified minimum operating flow rate for this motor of 600 gpm. Hence, flow rate of 680 gpm is theoretically sufficient to close the valve. Two scenarios are proposed to explain the failure of the dump sub to close during the surface test: 1) temporary obstruction (which had cleared by the time the dump sub was inspected) within the sub-assembly prevented the piston from moving down against the spring; 2) The actual flow rate was less than 680 gpm, and therefore, could have been less than the rate required to close the valve. As no evidence of any obstruction which would restrict the movement of the piston was found during the inspection, the first scenario appears unlikely. There are several facts suggesting that the second scenario explains the problem: 1)The subsequent motor run encountered the same downhole problems initially, although the dump sub was removed. It was only after one hour of experimenting with the drilling parameters that drilling could proceed; 2) The standpipe pressure was identical (1600 psi at 700 gpm flow) when drilling the wiper plug with the two motors, app. 500 psi lower pressure (bit pressure drop at 700 gpm) would be expected with the dump valve open; 3) No damage was found in any part of the motor ( rotating the string with an open dump valve results in reverse rotation of the motor driveshaft, and causes damage to the motor relatively quickly. This tends to suggest that the problems were caused by some other factor than a fault in the motor, possibly incompatibility between the bit and the wiper plug.sperry-sLri DRILLING SERVICES STANDARD SPERRYDRILL Motor Disassembly & Inspection Serial No: 963042 DUMP SUB - Upon disassembly the piston, upper sleeve and lower sleeve hard chrome plated sealing surfaces were all free from abrasion, corrosion and erosion damage.
