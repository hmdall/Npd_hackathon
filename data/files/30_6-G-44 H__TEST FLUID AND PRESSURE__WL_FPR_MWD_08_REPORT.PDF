The Optimized Test consists of multiple repeat tests of up to three drawdown-buildup (DD-BU) cycles for each test station. They are represented by three individual final buildup pressures and three mobility values. The latter are calculated using tool internal algorithm, which is based on Formation Rate Analysis FRASM (see below for further information). The measurements are taken while circulating (flow-on). The before and after annulus pressure measurements are influenced by hydrodynamic effects and do not represent hydrostatic mud pressure. The formation pressure measurement is, under normal conditions, not affected by the mud flow. Client Delivery Package Two types of the Client Delivery Package are offered. Both packages include reports, data plots and data fies of each run, performed with TesTrak: The Standard package mainly comprises automatically created reports and data files, delivered real-time as well as right after tool memory dump ('Rig-Floor' delivery). These are: Uplink Table, Run Summary Report, and LAS files. In addition, the Extended package includes detailed interpretation of each test. This package is delivered only on request. The interpretation within comprises an analysis based on FRA, which is well-known from Baker Atlas wireline service, such as RCITM. Data are delivered with the FRA Report. Uplink-Table (Real-time) A Microsoft Excel table that contains real-time data of each test-station performed. Besides the most important data - depth, pressure and mobility - it comprises large variety of information, which helps to make further decisions real-time. Some of them are lowest DD pressure, temperature gradient, or overall test time (including pad eject, testing and retract). As an additional feature, quality indicator - the QualityBit (QB) - helps to evaluate each test without time delay. This QB is automatically determined in the tool, based on the results from the tool FRA calculation as well as the FBU stabilization criteria. Run Summary Report (Memory - 'Rig Floor') An Adobe PDF document that shows general as well as specific information of each test-station performed. As TesTrak is able to perform Multiple Repeat Tests ('Optimized Test'), each test- station is represented by History plot composed of up to three tests (pressure, volume, temperature vs. time), Modulo plot (pressure vs. time) and data table. Modulo plots are intended to amplify the data part of the FBU pressures, which helps to QC the stabilization criteria for specific test. The data for modulo plots are listed in the Data LAS files.Data LAS files (Memory - 'Rig Floor') LAS files are in ASCII format and usually delivered in two types. LAS_0 files represent the whole test-station (three subsequent DD-BU tests for an 'Optimized Test'). LAS_123 files contain the individual data for each specific DD-BU cycle. Both file types are generated from memory data after each run. Each LAS file is composed of header, four major data columns - pressure, volume, temperature vs. time - and seven data columns with modulo data. LAS files from TesTrak fully meet industry standard requirements with LAS Format Version 2.0. FRA Report (Post-well analysis) A Microsoft Word / Adobe PDF document that shows the individual DD-BU cycles for each test. The report is performed by an experienced petrophysicist / log analyst / geologist post-well. Commonly, four plots are presented for each test: (1) History plot (2) FRA plot (3) DD/Formation Rate plot (4) Pressure match plot. For an Optimized Test, three sets of data plots are presented for each test station. All plots help to evaluate each test and receive the best information possible. Tests that are regarded as 'bad' are excluded from the evaluation.
