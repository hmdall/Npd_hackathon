One side-track was performed in the section 2757-3324 RKB due to differential sticking in the Intra Lange sst. The side-track were performed from 2998 RKB. Core no. was cut in the main hole and the logs through the Intra Lange II sandstone were run in the side-tracked hole. liner was set in this section from 2757-3324 RKB and borehole was drilled from the liner shoe to TD at 3958 RKB. In this Jurassic interval bit was lost at 3737 RKB. After an unsuccessful fishing job several attemps were made to side-track the well to continue drilling. While side-tracking, the drilling string slid back into the main hole and stopped at 3737 RKB. Fishing jobs which were performed after the unsuccessful side-tracks removed the old bit from the borehole. 4.1 Input data 4.1.1 Logs Three wireline logging runs were performed in the well. The LDL/CNL and DIL/LSS logs run no. were run twice due to problems in passing the depth m. The second logging run covered the interval 2757-3324 RKB. The wireline logs run in well 6507/2-2 are listed in table 4.1.1. MWD logs were run from the top of the well to the liner shoe. The Jurassic interval was not covered by MWD logs.NORSK HYDRO Exploration and Production Division Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 14 of 62 Logs Run no. Date Intv.

Due to sticking the tool string was split and the DIL/LSS and the LDL/CNL logs were run separately. 4.1.2 Log quality Washouts are present in shaly sequences in logging run no. 1 and 2. Cycle skipping occurs at some places in all three loggingHYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 15 of 62 runs, but this have no significance to the log analysis results. Mudcake is developed over the sandstones present in logging run no. and 3. In log LDL/CNL/GR no. 2C the caliper closed after the repeat section. The log was not run in the interval 3245-3039 RKB. Above this depth the log was run with the caliper closed. The caliper from the MSFL log was used for CNT hole corrections. Sticking affects the LDL/CNL/GR log no. 2C over the Lysing sst and the Intra Lange II sst. The supercombo run below the liner shoe had to be rerun due to sticking throughout the logged interval. The LDL/CNL run no. 3E was affected by sticking in several places and the logs were badly affected by sticking in the interval 3800-3900 RKB. The SP log is not present on the DIL/LSS run no. 3D due to grounding problems. The caliper indicates that the shale has swelled in the Jurassic interval. The borehole size is approximately throughout the shaly intervals in this section. The tool checks and calibration show that all tools were within calibration tolerances. 4.1.3 Log corrections Minor depth shifts have been made for all the logs used in this petrophysical evaluation. The GR logs run together with the DLL 2A and the DIL 3D have been used as referenceHYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 16 of 62 logs. The resistivity logs have been corrected for environmental effects and invasion. The GR logs have been corrected for environmental effects. Corrected log data are eclosed, enclosure 2. 4.1.4 Core data A total of cores have been cut in the well. The cored intervals, metres recovered, percent recovered and the applied depth shifts are listed in table 4.1.4. Core Intervals cut Formation Rec. Rec. Depth shifts Table 4.1.4 Cores used in the petrophysical evaluation The depths are driller's depths. Conventional core analysis was carried out by Geco. The analysis includes horizontal and vertical air permeability, helium porosity and grain density, figures and 4.2. The porosity was measured by using the Boyle's porosimeter. Core no. was cut in the main hole and the logs covering this interval were run in the side-tracked hole. Lateral variation of the Intra Lange II sandstone makes the depthshifting of the core to logger's depth difficult.HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 17 of 62 In the lower part of core no. the log derived porosity is lower than the porosity measured from core. This difference between core measured porosity and log derived porosity is probably due to desiccation of the clay minerals in the core. This can result in too high porosity from cores. The depth matching of core no. to logger's depth is uncertain because the total logging depth is just below the cored interval. Core porosity versus core permeability is presented in figures and 4.4. Figure shows the cores cut in the Cretaceous interval (core no. 1, and 3) and figure shows the cores cut in the Jurassic interval (core no. 4, and 6). The cross plots show poor correlation between porosity and permeability from the majority of the cores. 4.1.5 Formation temperature The temperatures listed in table 4.1.5 are DST temperatures, temperatures from RFT or Horner corrected temperatures from the logging runs.NORSK Exploration and Production Division HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 18 of 62 MD TVD TEMPERATURE COMMENTS (m RKB) (m RKB) (C) 2051.0 Log heading 2757.0 Horner 2825.0 DST 3264.5 RFT 3290.0 DST 3292.7 RFT 3320.0 Horner 3331.1 RFT 3679.1 RFT 3707.5 RFT 3748.6 RFT 3940.0 Horner Table 4.1.5 Formation temperatures, well 6507/2-2 The temperature development in the well is not linear. In the Upper Cretaceous interval the temperature gradient is C/100m. When entering the Lower Cretaceous interval an increase in temperature of approximately 30 C was observed. The measured temperature from DST is probably more reliable than the temperature taken from the logs at 2757 RKB. Thus, the real increase in formation temperature is less than 30 C. However, considerable increase in temperature did take place when entering the Lysing sandstone. In the Lower Cretaceous interval the temperature gradient is C. drop of 10 C occured when entering the Jurassic formations. In the Jurassic interval the temperature gradient is C. temperature plot of the well is presented in figure 4.5.NORSK Exploration and Production Division HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 19 of 62 4.1.6 Test results Two drill steam tests were performed in the well. Test no. 1 was performed in the Intra Lange II sandstone and test no. was performed in the Lysing sandstone. Another interval was planned to be perforated in the Intra Lange II sandstone. However, as the time schedule was exceeded and the first test produced gas/condensate, it was decided to skip the second interval in this sand. The preliminary test results are listed in table 4.1.6.

Lithological interpretation was made by visual inspection of all the logs and the additional available data. 4.2.2 Porosity The density log has been used for porosity calculations in the Lysing sst. and the Intra Lange sst. The porosity has been corrected for hydrocarbon effects. The density log is affected by sticking in the Intra Lange II interval. The sonic log has been used for porosity calculations in this section. 4.2.3 Water saturation Water saturation has been calculated from the Poupon-Leveaux equation in the virgin and the invaded zone. The DLL/MSFL combination was used for the Rt/Rxo computation in the Cretaceous sandstones Lysing and Intra Lange II. The DIL/SFLU logs were used for Rt/Rxo computation in the Intra Lange sandstone.

This value corresponds to mD for the cross plots of core no. and 2. porosity cutoff value of 10 % has been used for the Cretaceous interval in the nearby wells. The cutoff value used for shale volume is 40 %. To define net pay intervals cutoff value of 60 % has been used for water saturation.HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 22 of 62 4.3 Computation parameters Cretaceous interval The input parameters used in the Cretaceous interval are listed in table 4.3. 4.3.1 Lithology parameters GR log values for shale and clean sand were determined from visual inspections of the logs and additional lithological information. Histograms of matrix density from each core in the Cretaceous interval show an average matrix density of g/cc for all three cores. Figure shows histogram of matrix density from core no. 1, and 3. Shale density has been derived from histograms of bulk density in shaly zones. The shale density value used for the Lysing sst. is g/cc (figure 4.7) and the shale density value used for the Intra Lange sst. is g/cc (figure 4.8.). A fluid density of g/cc is used for the Cretaceous sands. This value is supported by density measurements performed during the test. Laboratory measurements of the fluid densities are not available at present. At shale value for the Intra Lange II sst. is picked from histogram of the sonic log through shaly interval, figure 4.9. At fluid has been picked from crossplot of the sonic log versus RHOB. Shale resistivities have been picked from crossplots of GR versus DLL and DIL across shaly zones, figures 4.10,HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 23 of 62 and 4.12. The shale resistivities used for the Lysing, Intra Lange II and Intra Lange sst. are ohmm, ohmm and ohmm, respectively. 4.3.2 Fluid parameters A mud filtrate resistivity of ohmm at C was used while drilling the Lysing and the Intra Lange II sandstones. This resistivity corresponds to salinity of 125000 ppm NaCl. The Intra Lange sandstone was drilled with mud filtrate resistivity of ohmm at 137 C. This corresponds to salinity of 70000 ppm NaCl. 4.3.3 Formation water parameters Rw in the Cretaceous interval has been based on the produced water from DST no. 1. The salinity of the produced water stabilized at approximately 15000 ppm Cl- (24750 ppm NaCl). This salinity corresponds to an Rw of at 75 C which has been used in the evaluation of both the Lysing and the Intra Lange sandstones. 4.3.4 a, and values The values used in this evaluation for a, and are 1, and 2, respectively.HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 24 of 62 Lysing I.Lange II I.Lange p matrix g/cc - g/cc p shale g/cc - g/cc p fluid g/cc g/cc g/cc At matrix : - 55 us/ft - At shale : - 102 us/ft - At fluid : - 280 us/ft - GR matrix : 45,40 API 50,45 API 30 API GR shale : 75,85 API 85 API 85 API R water (at 75 C) : ohmm ohmm ohmm Salinity (ppm NaC1) : R shale : ohmm ohmm ohmm a : m : n : Cutoffs: I) < 10 % Vsh > 40 % Sw > 60 (80) % Table Input parameters for the Cretaceous interval.

See figure for the formation temperature in the Jurassic interval. The a, and values used in the Jurassic interval are the same as those used for the Cretaceous interval, chapter 4.3.4. 4.4.1 Lithology The GR log has been used as shale indicator. cutoff value of the sonic log defines coal stringers in this interval. In addition visual inspections of all the logs have been made to define lithology in the Jurassic interval. 4.4.2 Porosity In intervals with good log quality of RHOB porosity was calculated from the density log. The sonic log has been used for porosity calculations in the interval 0 m RKB. 4.4.3 Water Saturation The DIL/SFLU combination is used for Rt/Rxo computation in the Jurassic interval. No DLL/MSFL logs are run in this interval. The water saturation is calculated from the Poupon-Leveaux equation, see chapter 4.2.3.HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 26 of 62 4.4.4 Cutoffs The trend from the cores in the Jurassic interval is very uncertain and has not been taken into account when establishing porosity cutoff value for the well, figure 4.4. The same porosity cutoff value which has been used for the Cretaceous interval is used for the Jurassic interval. A porosity cutoff value of 10 % has been used for both Cretaceous and Jurassic intervals in the nearby wells. 4.5 Computation parameters, Jurassic interval The input parameters used in the Jurassic interval are listed in table 4.5. 4.5.1 Lithology parameters GRshale and GRsand were determined from visual inspections of the logs and additional lithological information. A histogram of matrix density from core no. 4,5 and are presented in figure 4.13. Shale density used in the Jurassic interval is g/cc. The value was picked from histogram of RHOB through shaly zones, figure 4.14. At shale has been picked from histogram of the sonic log through shaly zones, figure 4.15. Crossplots of the GR log versus the ILD log have been used to define shale resistivity. The shale resistivities used are ohmm in the interval 3600-3800 RKB (figure 4.16) and ohmm in the interval 3800-3900 RKB (figure 4.17).NORSK Exploration and Production Division HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 27 of 62 4.5.2 Fluid parameters The mudfiltrate resistivity used while drilling the Jurassic interval was ohmm at 137 C. This corresponds to salinity of 70000 ppm NaCl. 4.5.3 Formation water parameters A pickett plot in the interval 5 RKB gives an Rw in the range of 0.025-0.035 ohmm at 137 C., figure 4.18. The Rt/Rxo = Rw/Rmf method gives an Rw in the range of 0.02-0.025 ohmm at formation temperature. However, the SFLU log reads deeper into the formation than an Rxo tool and the results from this method are in this case very uncertain. Rwa values have been calculated using density and sonic porosity. In the clean sandstones in the Garn and Ile formations the values of Rwa are in the range of 0.025-0.035 ohmm. The formation water in the adjacent wells are mainly somewhat less saline than what is observed in this well. However, one has chosen to emphasize on the result from the Pickett plot. The most probable formation water resistivity in the Jurassic interval of well 6507/2-2 is ohmm at 137 C. This resistivity corresponds to formation water salinity of 65000 ppm NaCl.HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 28 of 62 p matrix : g/cc g/cc p shale : g/cc g/cc p fluid g/cc g/cc At matrix - 55 us/ft At shale - 91 us/ft At fluid - 180 us/ft GR matrix 20,35 API 35,20 API GR shale 100 API 100 API R water (at 137 C) ohmm ohmm R shale ohmm ohmm a m n 0 < 10 % Sw > 60 % Table Input parameters for the Jurassic interval.S Core no.1 Core no.2 cei 2.! .s PHI PHIE DEC d*- Fig. .01 KVT MO 10000.x 10000. 2. 3.

RFT-HP run no. 2A and 2B were performed over the Cretaceous sandstones at 2825 and 3275 m. attempts were made to measure the formation pressure in the Lysing sandstone. The result was dry test and formation pressure measurements in the interval 2818.5-2829.5 MD. In the Intra Lange II sandstone (3264.5-3292.7 MD) 22 attempts were made to measure the formation pressure. 11 formation pressure measurements were achieved, 10 tests were dry and had lost seal. RFT-HP run no. 3B and 3C were performed in the interval 3331.1-3748.6 MD which covers the Cretaceous sandstone Intra Lange and the Jurassic formations Garn and Ile. In the Jurassic section formation pressure measurements were achieved. attempts resulted in seal failures. pressure measurements were obtained from the Cretaceous sandstone at 3331.1-3332.1 MD.

To establish gradient through 10 of sand very high accuracy of the RFT measurements is demanded. The deviation from gradient in the Cretaceous sands could be caused by operational problems as well as the RFT tool'sHYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 49 of 62 limitation. The pore pressure in the Lysing sandstone is bar/m (1.35 r.d.) and the pore pressure in the Intra Lange II sandstone is bar/m (1.50 r.d.). The pressure measurements achieved in the Lysing and Intra Lange II sandstones are presented in figures and 5.2. In the Intra Lange sandstone at 3330 the pore pressure is 0.157 bar/m (1.60 r.d.). The two pressure points obtained in this sandstone are not presented in figure. The pore pressure measurements achieved in the Jurassic formations give gradient of bar/m (1.03 g/cc), figure 5.3. The maximum pore pressure in this interval is 0.172 bar/m (1.75 r.d.) 5.2 Fluid sampling An attempt was made to collect segregated sample at 3270.5 MD. The gallon chamber was opened at this depth. Due to low permeability the tool was moved to 3280.9 MD where the gallon chamber was opened. The gallon chamber was sent ashore unopened and the gallon chamber was opened at the rig. The content of the gallon chamber was mudfiltrate and the gallon chamber contained mudfiltrate. Two segregated samples (2.75 + gallon) were obtained from the well at MD and MD. The gallon chambers were sent ashore unopened. Wellsite data from the 2.75 gallon chambers are listed in tables 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 and fluid analyses from the gallon chamber at are listed in table 5.2.3. The surface pressure of the gallon chamber at 2825m was measured to 60 bar at C on the rig floor. At the time the gallon chamber arrived at the laboratory, atmosphericHYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 50 of 62 pressure was observed. This was caused by leakage in the chamber packers. The content of the chamber was 80 cm' water. The fact that the gallon chamber from the same depth contained gas makes it probable that the gallon chamber also contained gas when brought to the rig floor. The gas has most likely disappeared with the decrease in pressure.

Laboratory analysis indicates that the produced water probably is representative for the formation water in the well. more saline formation water would result in higher hydrocarbon saturation in the Cretaceous sands. The Rw used in this evaluation corresponds to salinity of 25000 ppm NaCl. To illustrate the sensitivity of Rw an alternative interpretation has been made by using formation water salinity of 30000 ppm NaCl. The results are presented in figure 7.1. The light green colour shows the water saturation using formation water salinity of 25000 ppm NaC1 and the dark green colour represents 30000 ppm NaCl. The decrease in water saturation is in the range of 3-5 % for the Cretaceous sands. The shale volume is also attended with uncertainties in this interpretation. shale volume analysis has been performed by calculating Vsh from Density-Neutron crossplot, Density-Sonic crossplot and the GR log. Due to sticking on the density-neutron tool the GR log from DLL/MSFL has been used to calculate the shale volume. sensitivity analysis has been performed by increasing the value of clean sand from the GR log with API. Figure presents the differences in net sand when the GR value for clean sand is increased. The Intra Lange II sand is most sensitive to the change in this value, and the increase of 5 API increases the net sand in this interval with almost meters. However, the results presented in table are believed to be most reliable. Even though the density- neutron logs are to some extent affected by sticking over the Intra Lange II sand, the trends from these logs should give good indication of the shale volume. An increase of 2 in net sand is probably too optimistic according to the RHOB/NPHI logs. The other Cretaceous sands are hardly affected at all by the change of this input parameter.HYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 59 of 62 The Jurassic formations, especially the Garn Formation, are sensitive to the change in porosity cutoff value. However, the Jurassic formations are water bearing, and no sensitivity analysis has been performed for this section. 7.2 CONCLUSION The Cretaceous sandstones in well 6507/2-2 are hydrocarbon bearing. Lysing Fm. sandstone A cutoff value of 80 % for water saturation is applied from 2 RKB on the CPI plot. This cutoff value is used to avoid net sand above the net pay interval. The low hydrocarbon saturation interpreted in the top of the Lysing sandstone (2 RKB) might be caused by slow response of the resistivity log in the change in lithology from sand to shale, combined with poorer reservoir quality in this section. However, the reservoir properties in this interval are not believed to act as barrier and the hydrocarbon saturation is probably higher in the Lysing sand than what is interpreted from the logs. The results presented in table are calculated using 60 % as cutoff for water saturation throughout the Lysing sand. The very upper part of the Lysing sandstone is silica cemented with low porosity. The Lysing sandstone is gas/condensate bearing. The test produced 865000 m3/D gas and 80 m3/D condensate. From the logs hydrocarbon-water contact might be established at 2828.5 RKB. The produced water from the test can originate from the perforated zone below this depth. However, the estimated hydrocarbon-water contact is uncertain and hydrocarbons might be present throughout theHYDRO Petrophysical eval. report, well 6507/2-2 Page 60 of 62 Lysing sandstone in the well position. Intra Lange Fm. II sandstone The reservoir quality is good in the Intra Lange II sandstone. Lateral variations are observed in the sandstone from the main hole to the side-track. The test produced 639000 m'/D of gas and 124 m'/D of condensate. Only the lower part of the sandstone was perforated and tested. It is therefore unlikely to believe that water contact is present in this sandstone in the well position. Intra Lange Fm. sandstone The sandstone has good reservoir properties. The RFT sample from RKB contained gas and condensate. The lack of a Rxo log through this sandstone makes it difficult to distinguish between residual and moveable hydrocarbons. No hydrocarbon-water contact is established from the logs. Jurassic interval The Jurassic formations in the well are water bearing. The reservoir quality is moderate in the evaluated formations. An increase in hydrocarbon saturation is observed in the Are Formation. This can be related to the coal stringers present at this depth which might have potential of hydrocarbon generation. However, the determination of hydrocarbon saturation is uncertain in the Are Formation and consequently the net pay zones are discriminated.IOM loid Almsues MU Formations, Cretaceous Cretaceous Intra Lange Sst.
