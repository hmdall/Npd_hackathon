Self aquitaine a/s 25/1__BR REENTRY OF FRIGG drilling and completion dptSubject: REENTRY OF FRIGG OBSERVATION WELL 25/1-8 Date: 11/09/1990 Action: P. FLEURY, DCD From: Reservoir Dept. F. VIAUD INi Info: N. GAMGIT, LM FRUCHET RM, HG RelNo: 311E-R/90 *34,2 IF-LI Reentry and abandonment of 25/1-8 observation well had initially been planned end 1990, when drilling activity resumes. Looking at Exploration budgets constraints, it is now clear that this reentry must be postponed until the end of 25/5-4 well. This leads to informations on Frigg field being obtained late January, early February 91. It is compatible with preparation of Frigg DCQ gas sales nominations for Spring 1991. Frigg budget should be modified accordingly.

From: Drilling& Completion I Info: R. BEAUSEIGNEUR, A. BOUKOULOU, C. CLEMENT - DCD Ref. No: 311E-DC-90 29402/TN/Ij Please arrange for trawling operations over the following well sites: Well 25/3-1 Well 25/1-7R Well 25/5-3 Well 2/6-4 The scope of work of the overtrawling operation is as follows: 1. Trawling square area of 3000 meters, with an overlap of net tracks of approximately 20 m. 2 Describe carefully any removed object as soon as the item is brought onboard. 3. Take two similar Polaroid pictures of each object (small ones may be grouped, one picture will be included in the final report to NPD, the other will remain an FAN copy). Photographs of large objects will be taken from more than one angle. In all cases a panel with the word 'TRAWLING and the name of the well must appear on the photographs. 4. All objects removed from the seabed must be brought to Dusavik Yard for possible inspection by NPD. 5. formal report on the over trawling operations should be submitted to DCD, along with the photographs, for possible review by the authorities. This should be completed within 15 days of completion of the operation. Trawling operations shall be under the supervision of MSD. Provisions should be made to have representative, if required, onboard the trawl vessel during the operation. Please be aware of the following obstructions with the areas of the trawl activities. 25/1-7R. 1.5m 7mm Pipe Stuck to Bottom (refer attached survey report). In addition, 25/1-7R is close to the Alwyn and Odin Flowlines, therefore precautions should be taken while trawling. Please notify DCD of the proposed trawl dates, we shall in turn notify the authorities, ESSO and TOM. Regards, P. eury4. 2 - ABSTRACT The semisubmersible WEST VANGUARD which belongs to the SMEDVIG Company was planed to move from the exploration well 25/5-3 to the re-entry well 25/1-7R. A Syledis system was used to position the rig and an anchor handling tug. The permanent Syledis chain was installed on permanent platforms by WIMPOL and contracted by GEOTEAM. One Syledis mobile station was installed on tug ODIN VIKING, then on tug SOLFONN, second one on the rig in order to help manovering, marker buoys were dropped 100 ahead of the intended anchor position 1, 4, and 8. An acoustic SIMRAD system was onboard the rig to interrogate transponder previously fixed on the well head. 3 - POSITIONING SYSTEMS 3.1 - Syledis 3.1.1 - Fair Isle Chain The Syledis is short-medium range radio-navigation system working on the 400 Mhz band. The Fair Isle Chain is permanent chain operated by WIMPOL with permanent beacons on Platforms BERYL, BRAVO, FRIGG QP, BERYL ALPHA, HEYMDAL and ODIN.5. J J  j  All cables an units are tested and bench calibrated before installation ; there is not any calibration in situ, the total delays are calculed as the sum of sequential delay (cable, unit, connector...). The chain is working continuously ; some beacon could be off sometimes due to radio silent onboard platform. Coordinates of derrick mounted beacons on ODIN and HEYMDAL are subject to change as derricks could move between drillslots. We have never got from WIMPOL any description of the stations but only a telex with coordinates, delays, reply slots, H.T. Coordinates were supplied in the NORSNET System (ED50/SN80), but they were modified to get them in the local datum (FRIGG NCO 77). FRIGG NCO 77  NORSNET - AE N - AN AE  +0,7 ; AN  +5,311. Solution (Mobile 300) 479 086,9 y  605 468,9 Position obtained when the rig arrived on 27/01/90. 479 088,8 y  605 467,6 Ax - 1,9 Ay + 1,3 m. These two solutions were very close and in agreement with the accuracy expected (Appendix 3). 3.2 - Simrad The SIMRAD HPR 305 is an hydroacoustic position reference system which can supply the relative position of transponder (laid on sea bed) referred to the rig structure. This position is displayed on VDU screen. The installation of this system onboard the rig was not permanent, the transducer was just fixed on pipe in the moonpool. A calibration of the system was carried out. That consist to immerse from the rig transponder at the same depth as the transducer in given heading (axes of the rig) and at known distance (40 m). The witness transponder image on the control screen allowed to adjust transducer heading and to rectify diagram scale. In depth of 100 the range of the system is about 350 but accuracy value is maximum when the derrick is on the vertical of the well (at this position the accuracy is very bad). I 12. _1 The mounting system was not rigid so the system could be used only when the rig was stopped, close to the final position (about 40 metres). Equipment onboard the rig 1 HPR 305 unit 1 Gyro-compass Robertson SKR-82 - Transducer 1 Computer - Cable, bracket - Spare. A SIMRAD transponder frequency code 20492 HZ was installed on the protection cage. The accuracy expected was about 1,5 of the vertical of the well. 4 - GEODETIC PARAMETERS All ELF Coordinates in FRIGG area are given in FRIGG NGO DATUM 77. This system is pseudo ED 50 tied doppler point on CDP1 platform and accepted by both UK and NORWAY governments in order to define the UK-NORWAY boundary line in FRIGG area.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 1.1 GENERAL The Si RAO PR-309 Hydroacoustic Position Re- ference system is designed to provide reliable and precise means of establishing position relative to an underwater structure on the ocean floor, or to submersible. The system can be used as stand-alone navigation system. Or it can be integrated with surface naviga- tion systems to establish absolute position. The HPR-309 system is based on the supershort baseline SS BL principle with the acoustic transmit/- receive elements housed in one single transducer unit, providing simple and compact installation. The position calculation is based on range and direc- tion measurements to one transponder, giving the relative position between the transducer and the transponder. The system can measure the position of up to sixteen different transponders. Refer to table for standard interrogation and reply frequencies. Adaption to other types of transponders can be achieved by modifying software parameters. Simul- taneous use of multiple transponders is possible by utilizing individual interrogation and reply frequen- cies. To ensure fai(-safe operation of the system in en- vironments with high noise levels, blocking of sound by air, drilling mud etc., two or more separately mounted transducer units can be employed. Abnormal conditions or system malfunction are dis- played on the control panel, and aids in minimizing the down time. A complete system with standard transducer is shown in figure 1.  - - The HPR-309 system comprises the following main units:  Display & Control Unit including microcomputer and power supply  Transceiver including microcomputer, transdu- cer switch and power Supply  Transducer(s) containing preamplifiers and beam switches  TranspondertS)  Vertical reference Interface  Standard gyroscope interface The transponder constitutes the acoustic reference source of the equipment and transmits single pulse when interrogated by an acoustic signal of specific frequency. On receipt of the pulse or coded signal, the transducer performs highly accurate measurement of direction to the transponder rela- tive to the transducer. Simultaneously, the elapsed time between interrogation and reception is mu- sured to give the slant range to the transponder. By using this information the ship's position relative to the transponder can be computed with high ac- curacy. The HPR-309 system can be extended with the features required to be integrated in an acoustic control system for blow-out preventers and produc- tion trees, providing two-way telemetry communica- tion with the SIMRAD ACS-300 Acoustic Control Subsea Unit. Refer to separate intonation regard- ing the SIMRAD HPR-309A Acoustic Control and Navigation System. Figure details the various uses of the system:  Position reference for dynamic positioning of diving support vessel  Tracking operations (bottom tow of pipeline)  Tracking of tethered vehicles and submersibles  Positioning of drilling rigs, riser angle measure- ments and BOP control  Acoustic control of subsea production units  Pipeline inspection with Tracking Transducer1.8 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 101482E .3 DISPLAY AND CONTROL UNIT The S1MRAD 11PR-309 Display and Control Unit houses the following main units :  Microcomputer  CRT display system  Power supply module The cabinet is designed for installation in panel and can also be delivered with forks for table top, bulkhead or overhead mounting, or for Instal- lation in 19 rack. - All controls and indicators required to operate the ' system are accessible on the front panel, except for raising and lowering of the transducer which either can be performed from control unit located at the unit site, or from remote hull unit nnntml lutated at the bridge.  DEFLECTION TRANSISTOHS CRT The display is an CRT with an engraved circular scale. The vessel is normally located in the center of the display with the alongships direction along the y- axis. The horizontal position at the transponder relative to the vessel, is displayed on the screen by dedicated symbols.

The remote display thus constitutes back-up for the main display and control unit in the event of breakdown. When operating as remote display it cannot be used to enter data into the HPR-300 Transceiver. However, scale range and display of position data can be selected independently of the data pres- ented on the main display. The reference point of the CRT picture and its orientation may also be selected locally.

A complete hull unit arrangement is shown in figure 1.10. The mounting flange Is welded to the hull bottom and serves as base for the transducer raise/lower arrangement, The height of the mounting flange varies according to the specific Installation require- ments, the standard height however, is 200 mm.The mounting flange carries the gate valve which per- mits onboard transducer replacement. The transducer dock above the gate valve hOusaa the transducer when the system is In fully raised position. The bearing sleeve forming the bottom end of the hull unit Is attached to the upper flange of the transducer dock. The bearing sleeve absorbs the forces caused by the water current Imposed on the transducer and transducer shaft and must be pro- perly fixed to the ship's hull. it is recommended not to have transducer in lowered position at ship's speed exceeding 10 knots.

The transducer can be turned 180 degrees horizontally In seconds. This allows tracking of one or more transponders with measurement repetition fre- quency satisfying most offshore applications. The procedure for tracking of transponder is per- formed automatically as follows:  Searches for the transponder(s) in wide beam.  Directs the transducer towards the transpon- der(s) and decides which narrow beam has the transponder closest to its centerline.  Switches to that narrow beam and tracks the transponder(s).

Transducer with 30Y160' beamwidth (cannot be delivered for standard hull unit). The narrow beam transducer is primarily Intended to be used when high position accuracy is required. When using the 30.' receiver beamwidth the hori- zontal accuracy within its operating range is better than 1% of the slant range. In order to combine the narrow beam accuracy with long range position reference, the tracking transducer is recommended. Additional Standard Transponder(s) The basic PR system is delivered with one stands' transponder. It is designed, however, for operation yr- up to sixteen different transponders. a driety of transponders with different battery lire 319fres and specifications is available: SYSTEM DSCRPTOM Pi 482E Mllualude Small type transponders with reduced battery life are available specially intendod for uco on rtheo where space is limited, or for use by divers. Miniature Responder If position reference Is required In an area with excessive acoustic noise, It is recommended that responder be employed. It differs from trans- ponder In that the interrogation pulse and power is supplied through cable. The Miniature Responder is convenient where space is restricted, e.g. on submersible, ais.,,Jonder/Transponder Illsponder including transponder function Is also tillable. This type responder/transponder swItc- 'nes automatically to transponder mode if the cable is accidentally cut. Another option permits simul- taneous responder and transponder opration. The dimensions of the responder/transponder are equal to those of the standard transponder. Depth Transponder A special type transponder is available with built-in depth sensor which enables errors introduced by ray bending due to temperature layers to be reduced. he depth transponder measures actual depth using a pressure sensor, and transmits the depth back to . the HPR system which uses this information when computing the position ot the transponder. Olinorneter Transponder .e inclinometer telemetry transponder can re- motely monitor and telemeter two channels of an- gular information for an underwater location to surface interrogator. It orovines cnnvenient mane of angular measurement for many applications in- cluding: - Rise angle measurement - Structural monitoring - Proelaying profiles When interrogated the transponder generates triple tone burst reply, the angular information being encoded and transmitted as the delays between the reply pulses. The two penclulus inclinometers used as the sen- sors are mounted orthogonally and have reso- lution of 1/2. The inclinometers and signal con- ditioning electronics are preset during manufacture to give the required angular span for specific application. For riser angle monitoring the unit is preset to measure angles within 15^ of vertical In both axis. The transponder operates on the same receiving and transmitting frequencies as the standard trans. panda, arid flares the same transeluttae, oh:n-6v- nics and battery pack, but Is supplied in larger housing to accommodate the additional signal con- ditioning electronics and inclinometers. To conserve power the signal conditioning elec- tronics is normally switched off and Is only powered up for approximately second following each inter- rogation. This provides sufficient time for the en- coding and transmission of the data Beacon A beacon utransponaeni Is pinger whiCh auto- matically transmits acoustic pulses at regular inter- vals. The beacon Is also available with built-in depth sensor for automatic transmission of depth to the PR system. The beacon Is switched on manual- ly when deployed at the required subsea position. Emergency Transponder System An emergency system Is available to meet the demands for relocation of e.g. lost diving bell. The system Is based on two light weight miniature transponders that- operate on frequencies away from the heavily used frequency bands. The transponders are of the type 7097 Operated by different interrogation frequencies of kHz (A) and kHz (8) respectively, whereas the reply frequency of kHz Is common to the two trans- ponders. The intention of the emergency relocation system is to mark the operating bell with one of the trans- ponders, and Install the other one on the rescue bell, If and when required. The position of the emergency transponders are represented on the HPR display by the letters and B. The emergency tra nsponders may also be relocated by means of the handheld Emergency Locator type 7106 which is furnished with directional trans-P1482a 2.

RIG MOVING AND POSITIONING 7.1. Positioning The S/S NORTRYM shall be placed on the location: This well is equipped with SIMRAD transponder Frequency code For the Re-entry of well 25/1-8, the main obstacle to the positioning the rig is the Odin 20 gas line. See attached drawing. This location is approximately: - 1120 from the Odin 20 gas line at its nearest point. - 2360 N.E of DP2 platform. Due to the position's proximity to the Odin line special positioning/anchoring procedure has been established. All the vessels involved in the operation along with the rig shall be equipped with the position/anchoring plan of the Nortrym drawn on to Frigg of They shall also have copy of EAN's platform Management Manual procedure 13 and 14 along with this Positioning and Anchoring Procedure. The positioning equipment used shall be rented from Nimpol Norge A/S. 7.2. Positioning System on Frigg The Consyl Alwyn / Frigg Syledis chain with directional beacons located on Frigg CDP1, Odin, Neimdal and Beryl will be used for the rig positioning. 7.3. Survey of Odin Pipeline A supply boat will mark the Odin pipeline with buoys installed in to the side of the pipeline between the pipeline and the proposed location at its nearest point. These buoys will propably be of the Spar Type, with flashing red lights. Marker buoys with flashing white lights will also be installed on each of the intended anchor positions closest to the pipeline (3 , and 5). The buoys will be dropped 100 ahead of the intended anchor position, travelling in the direction of the anchor line, to allow for more accurate vessel positioning when dropping the anchors. These buoys will assist in positioning operations during the setting of anchors on the location. safety margin of 200 in will be used around the Odin pipeline. No anchor will be allowed to be set inside this 200 in safety margin. See anchor pattern and disposition. One positioning expert from SNEA(P) will be onboard the supply boat during these operations. The supply boat will load on board the following equipment: - Syledis Mobile station with accessories.OP _isc 81/REENTRY The well is equipped with SIMRAD transponder Frequency code25188HZ \.___________ This location is approx:  - km North of DP2 - km from the 32 gas line to St. Fergus at its nearest point - km from the 20 Odin gas line at its nearest point - km from the UK/Norway Median line - km from the 24 Alwyn gas line at its nearest point Due to the distance from these pipelines special precautions will be taken but it is not considered necessary to go to the extent of marking the pipe lines. All the vessels involved in the operation shall be equipped with position/anchoring plan and General Lay out of Sea Bed lines IF 00 00 00 119 and detailed location drawing to follow. They shall also have EANis Platform Management Manual Procedures 13 & 14 and this Positioning and Anchoring Procedure for S/S NORTRYM well 25/1-7. on Frigg COP-1, Odin, Heimdal and Beryl will be used for the rig 7.3. Towing of S/S Nurtrym The rig will be towed from HOYLANDSBYGD using vessel, yet to be chosen, having + 100 Tons bollard pull. In case of failure of the towing boat when in the Trigg area the S7S NORTRYM is capable of the self propulsion at a speed of Knots in weather conditions acceptable for anchoring. 7.4. Marking of Location Just prior to the pulling of anchors on the previous location, supply boat loaded with Syledis Mobile Station, surveyor and marker buoys will mark the well location. One marker buoy with flashing light attached to rod will be set in each of of the anchor positions chosen by the Captain onboard NORTRYM. (In fact the buoys will be dropped 100 ahead of the intended anchor position, travelling in the direction of the anchor line, to allow for more accurate vessel positioning when dropping the anchors).Subject: Distribution of TENDERS Received CONTRACT - Well-head Cutting Services Date: 22 February, 1991 Action: Re-entry well 25/1-8R A.

However when using mild steel cad plated gaskets the connector is failing to hold pressure from functional and dimensional checks believe the connector to be perfectly okay. In my opinion the problem stems from the mild steel gasket being too soft allowing it to be crushed beyond its sealing capacity. It is our intention to ship this connector back to you on the understanding that you advise customer that he must use stainless steel gaskets until the mild steel gasket issue is resolved.
