The survey was carried out in two parts; pipe conveyed run using Schlumberger tool, and wireline run using Read tool. During the pipe conveyed run the source had constant offset from the receiver tool of 1500m to the south, while the wireline run had conventional vertical incidence geometry. The pipe conveyed tool used was CSAT with GAC accelerometer sensors. Data were acquired by the CSAT every 15m from 4032m to 2900m (in effect the entire length of the 1/2 liner). The wireline tool was run from 2900 to 1800m with the sensors at lm intervals. No problems were seen during acquisition, although the noise was never enough to obscure first arrivals. Generally, the data were of good quality although some levels above 3610m on the pipe conveyed run were noisy due to lack of good cement. 1.2 General Information Well: 34/7P-42A Contractor: Read Well Services, Schlumberger Survey Dates: 24th September 1998 Installation/Higi Snorre TLP Witness: Dave Richards Company Geophysicist: Jon Sandvik Survey Objectives: Acquire data to improve the understanding of geophysical models and for seismic inversion studies Survey Type: Constant Offset and Normal Incidence VSPs. 1.3 Survey Details Survey Interval and tool spacing No levels Constant Offset TLC VSP 0m MDRKB @ 15m 75 Normal Incidence VSP 0m MDRKB @ 10m 108 1.4 Operational Details Logging tool combination 1.

ID Block' Well Dale wireline run. Problems: 1. Loss of communication between the Schlumberger system and the navigation PC. Performance: TLC: Good. Could have been better if it were not for the computer problems. Wireline: Excellent acquisition performance. Software fault prevented full report being produced. Data Quality: Generally good except in intervals with bad cement.2 VSP CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 2.1 Conclusions  Were the objectives of the survey met? Yes.  Was the data quality acceptable? Yes. Some noise was visible on TLC levels above the top of cement at 3610, but generally the quality was good. strong downgoing seabed multiple is visible on the normal incidence data.  Was depth accuracy acceptable ? Yes. The TLC run tied in to within 0.5m with the CBL log. The wireline run depth error was 1.4m at the end of the survey - tool shallow. wireline level at 2909m corresponds to TLC level at 2907m. The time pick for this level on the TLC run was 1175ms break-break, and the pick for the wireline level was I187ms peak-peak. As the theoretical increase in apparent travel time seen picking peak to peak (compared with break to break) is about 12ms, it was concluded that the wireline run was on depth compared to the TLC run.  Was navigation acceptable ? Yes. The transit of the platform taken before the survey indicated no gross errors in the navigation system. The last third of the TLC run was shot without navigation data being recorded to the seismic data headers because of Schlumberger computer fault. However, close check was kept on the acquisition and navigation shot numbers so that merging the navigation data should be straightforward. The shots for the TLC run were usually within 5m of the target, while the weather for the wireline run meant that shots were within 25m of the target.  Details of the survey that require further discussion. See comments elsewhere. 2.2 Recommendations A good survey all round, spoilt by the failure of the Schlumberger system to record navigation data. Schlumberger should investigate and rectify the cause of this failure.  Points to follow up or for processing to be aware of or check The data from the TLC were recorded using accelerometers in the tool. Transit times were recorded break to break. Picking times peak to peak results in travel times approximately 12ms longer. Wireline data were geophone data and picked peak to peak. Navigation data could not be recorded on the seismic data headers for the TLC run above 3257m. Pay careful attention to record numbers and depths when merging the navigation data with the seismic data. The two logs available to correlate with the GR recorded on TLC did not agree. Determine which log should be taken as gospel before depth shifting the TLC run. The TLC VSP was 3m shallow compared with Run IA - DS1/MDT Sep 98, but on depth compared with CBL log 24 Sep 98. The hydrophone recorded and used as time zero for the TLC run was far field hydrophone 7.5m deep. The hydrophone for the wireline run was 1.5m deep.Petroleum as...ri  Suggestions to improve performance of survey. None.  Suggestions to improve speed of survey Investigate running level CSAT in combination on TLC.  Suggestions to improve safety of survey. Appropriate work permits were in force for the duration of the survey. All rig personnel involved wore the correct protective clothing. At the end of rigging down after the wireline run, the cable head fell from the crane hook while being lifted down from the drill floor. This incident is still the subject of investigation on the Snoire platform. It is unlikely to have been caused by equipment failure and is probably the result of some inattention by personnel involved in wireline operations. No unsafe occurrences were reported from the Ocean ICnarrPetroleum ASNO1 U24P42 3 VSP TIMING ANALYSIS This section gives details of the time taken to log this survey, and how long the equipment and personnel were needed. The lists given are calculated from the daily log, and provide breakdown of the activities of the contractor during mobilisation for this survey. The times are rounded to the nearest minutes. Mobilisation starts and ends at shore base /heliport. Standby and commissioning figures are best estimates rather than accurate times, and include periods of inactivity such as rest. 3.1 Rig time and levels per hour Date September Start Time Operation VSP Survey Standby /Rest Comm decom Rig up down R1H POOH Down time 20 1300 Read arrive on Snorre.
