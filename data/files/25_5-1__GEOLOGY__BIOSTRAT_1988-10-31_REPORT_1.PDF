BoussenS Bousseng Saint MartoryAUTHORS : J.DUCAZEAUX -J.ACHERITEGUY-JC.JAGLIN-JL.VOLAT TITLE : WELLS 25/5-1 (NORWAY) Biostratigraphy of the interval 620-3392m TD REFERENCES : EP/S/EXP/Lab. n88/14ORP/BI ABSTRACT The biostratigraphical study of well 25/5-1 has been carried out between 620 and 3392m (TD) by using micropaleontological, palynological and calcareous nannofossil technics. The studied interval ranges through Late Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary (Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene and Early Miocene). Nine palynozones (NJ1, NJ2a, NJ2b, NJ3al, NJ3a4, NJ4b1, NJ6a and NJ7) characterize the Jurassic deposits ranging through Hettangian, Sinemurian, Pliensbachian, Toarcian, Early Bathonian, Early-Middle Callovian and Kimmeridgian. The thickness of the biozones appears to be extremely dependant of the structural features and strong unconformities have been evidenced.CONTENTS Pages AB TRACT - Micropaleontology ................................. 1.1 - Introduction .................................. 1.2 - Zonation and paleoecological data.............. 2 - Palynology ........................................ 2.1 - Introduction .................................. 2.2 - Interval to 2565m - Lower Tertiary .... 2.3 - Interval to 2895m - Upper Cretaceous 11 2.4 - Interval 2917m to 3349m - Jurassic ............ 12 2.5 - Interval 3362m to 3392m - Late Triassic ....... 17 3 - Calcareous Nannofossils ........................... 18 3.1 - Introduction .................................. 18 3.2 - Zonation ...................................... 18 3.3 - Conclusions ................................... 23 4 - Conclusions ....................................... 24 I.LIST OF FIGURES AND PLATES Figure : Location map Figure 2a - 2b - 2c : 25/5-1 well summary Figure Plate : Plate : Plate : : Well 25 /5-1 - Age breakdowns Stratigraphical distribution of mineralized microfossils and paleoecological evolution Palynological range-chart Frequency of selected palynomorphs in Middle and Lower Jurassic Plate : Stratigraphical distribution of calcareous nannofossils Plate : Biostratigraphical summary (620-1220m) Plate : Biostratigraphical summary ( (1220-1900m) Plate : Biostratigraphical summary (1900-2600m) Plate : Biostratigraphical summary (2600-3392m)1 - :IICROPALEONTOLOGY 1.1 - Introduction The micropaleontological study of well 25/5-1 has been carried out from 1100m to 3430m (T.D.). Cores and composite cutting samples were washed for free microfauna at about to 20m interval in the Cenozoic series, and to 30m interval in the Mesozoic. The core samples so far analysed are devoid of any microfauna. 1.2 - Zonation and paleoecological data 1.2.1 - Interval 1050-1230m - Elphidium subnodosum zone - Late Oligocene The rich and diverse fauna is strongly dominated by calcareous Foraminifera. Sponge spicules are present from the top of the interval. The zonal marker is fairly frequent from the first sample. Few Diatoms and planktic Foraminifera (including Globorotalia nana), and almost no agglutinated Foraminifera. Environment : outer neritic. 1.2.2 - Interval 1230-1270m - Asterigerina g-uerichi zone - Late Fauna is quite similar. The zonal marker is scarce (only present at the top of the zone but occurs with the first numerous specimen of Turrilina alsatica. The very few planktic Foraminifera are likely to be caved. 1..3 - Interval 1270-1610m - Rotaliatina bulimoides zone - Early The zonal marker occurs from the top of the zone. The upper, middle and lower part of the zone are recognized at 1370m (middle) and 1570m (lower). Arenaceous Foraminifera dominate the- - 1* I assemblage, whilst planktic are absent. The numerous Radiolaria occurring at the base of the zone are indicative of the Radiolaria (3rd) zone, which points to earliest Oligocene. The lowermost Oligocene zone is not recognized (Globocassidulina carapitana zone) but this is probably due to the scarcity of the zonal marker rather than to hiatus in the series. Upper bathyal environment. 1.2.4 - Interval 1610-1790m - Karreriella gr. indigens zone - Late Eocene Only arenaceous Foraminifera are present within this interval. The zonal marker appears conspicuously at the top. Glomospira charoides shows an acme in this zone, as well as the flat Radiolarians which indicate the Radiolaria (2nd) zone. 1.2.5 - Interval 1710-1950m - Ammomarginulina foliaceus zone - Middle Eocene The zonal marker is fairly frequent from the top of the interval. Abundant smooth-walled forms such as Trochammina inflata and Haplophragmoides hirhi occur near the base of the interval, and in the underlying zone. The large reniform sponge spicules (Rhaxella NOR AL50) disappear downwards near the top of this zone. Environment : Upper Bathyal. 1.2.6 - Interval 1950-2010m - Cyclammina amplectens zone - Middle Acme of the zonal marker and frequent smooth walled arenaceous Foraminifera.

The microfauna is essentially arenaceous in the upper part of the interval, with clear increase in the frequency of Karreriella gr. indigena. The lower part of the interval, from 2150m, yields calcareous microfauna dominated by Oridorsalis umbonatus. The last sample 2180-2190m gave few planktic Foraminifera attributable to Subbotinna gr. linaperta. Few Coscinodiscus sp.1 are probably reworked. Environment : Upper bathyal. 1.2.8 - Interval 2200-2330m : Coscinodiscus sp.1 zone - Early Eoecene to late Paleocene The interval yields numerous specimens of Coscinodisucs sp.1, with an impoverished arenaceous microfauna and few planktic Foraminifera of the linaperta group. As it is highly probable that Coscinodiscus sp.1 is exclusive of any other microfauna, the Foraminifera are considered as cavings. 1.2.9 - Interval 2330-2370m : Spiroplectammina spectabilis - Late Paleocene Downwards disappearance of Coscinodiscus sp.1, and progressive enrichment in arenaceous Foraminifera ; higher frequency of the zonal marker. 1.2.10 - Interval 2370-2410m - Hormosina ovulum gigantea zone (part) - Late Paleocene Arenaceous Foraminifera predominate. From 2390m to 2420m, at Radiolaria occur. Environment : Upper bathyal- Z1 - 1.2.11 - Interval 2410-2510m - Hormosina ovulum g-igantea zone - Early Paleocene Downwards occurrence of quite rich assemblage of planktic Foraminifera (Planorotalites compressus, Morozovella pseudobul- loides ...). Calcareous benthic Foraminifera are well represented. Racliolaria still occurring are regarded as caved. Environment : Outer neritic. 1.2.12 - Interval 2510-2580m - Matanzia varians zone - Early Similar assemblage, with frequent occurrence of the zonal marker. 1.2.13 - Interval 2580-2680m : Unnamed zone - No age assigned There is complex mixing of Paleocene and Late Cretaceous Foraminifera, the latter belonging to the Early Maastrichtian! Campanian, some of the former occurring here for the first time. These intricate assemblages occurring in large composite cutting samples make it difficult to recognize which is caved or which is reworked on the soleevidence of microfauna. Hence the question is left open. It will be recalled that few cavings have been observed in well 25/5-1, out of this interval. 1.2.14 - Interval 2680-2890m - Gansserina gansseri zone to Globotruncanita caicarata zone - Early Maastrichtian to Late Campanian Planktic dominated microfauna, with occasional benthic calcareous Foraminifera are observed. The assemblage globally points to an Early Maastrichtian to Late Campanian age, although few speci- mens could be derived from the Late Maastrichtian. It is suggested that they are caved from very thin Late Maastrichtian layer. Ecology : Cuter neritic.- - 1.2.15 - Sample 2900-2910m - Unnamed zone - Early Cretaceous This sample gave mixed fauna from different early Cretaceous stages (Cenomanian, Albian, possible Aptian, Barremian probably highly condensed in thin layers.

Most of the scarce assemblage is caved from higher levels. 1.2.19 - Sample 3110-3130m - Unnamed zone - Late Pliensbachian Nodosariidae and Ostracoda characteristic of Late Pliensbachian Environment : Outer marine. 1.2.20 - Sample 3140-3160m - Unnamed zone - Pliensbachian Similar fauna - Age inferred.-4- 1.2.21 - Sample 3170-3180m - Unnamed zone - Early Pliensbachian Similar fauna - Index Ostracoda (Ogmoconcha sp.18) point to an early Pliensbachian age. 1.2.22 - Sample 3411-3430m - Unnamed zone - Sinemurian ? to Hettangian ? Similar fauna - Rare and poorly preserved Ostracods indicate Sinemurian - Hettangian age.2 - PALYNOLOGY 2.1 - Introduction Palynological analyses have been carried out on three intervals detailed below. Emphasis is given to the Jurassic series. Quantitative analyses have been performed on the cored section between and 3056.50m (Sleipner Formation and upper part of Dunlin Formation) and between and 3289m (Statfjord Formation). Detailed quantitative diagrams are shown on Plate 3. 2.2 - Interval to 2565m - Lower Tertiary The palynological study is entirely based on the analysis of 10 sidewall core samples and detailed subdivision of the interval is hampered by the poor sidewall core coverage. The palynological results on sidewall core samples have been used with regard to their correlation to the micropaleontologicai results on cutting samples only. The palynological and micropaleontological diagnostic evidence are summarized on Plate 7. The comparison of these data allow biostratigraphical subdivision in terms of palynozones to be suggested through Early Eocene and Paleocene series. The upper limit is based on the following micropaleontological evidence : the first downhole occurrence of Spiroplectammina navarroanna at 2000-2010m. The IIC zone is positively identified at 2086.50m assemblage with Eatonicysta ursulae, Dracodinium and Kisselovia edwarsii has been recovered at .Frecuent megaspores Azolla can be retained as indicator (SWC) . Rich pachydermum this depth. fresh water- - - 2123.20m - lib Zone - Early Eocene Positive palynological evidence for the occurrence of the lib zone is encountered at 2123.20m ( SWC) . Rich assemblage with Kisselovia coleothrypta sensu Elf, Wetzeliella cf. lunaris D. 417b, Eatonicysta ursulae... has been observed. The boundary between lib and IIc zones cannot be more accurately precised. 2.2.3 - 2180/90m-2205m - ? Upper Ila zone - Early Eocene Due to poor quality samples, the definition of the Upper IIa zone and the exact extent of the zone cannot be determined. The occurrence of common Subbotinna linaperta at 2180-2190m could be related to the occurrence of the Upper IIa zone. It is considered possible, but this planktonic foraminifera is also known in youngest series (Hb zone). The SWC sample at 2205m reveals marked influx of terrestrial pollen grains which dominate the palynological assemblage. The marine dinocysts are frequent. High amounts of reworldngs are to be considered. These reworked elements seems to be derived from older strata : * Earliest Eocene : (Middle Ila zone) - Frequent Deflandrea oebisfeldensis (pyritic) and abundant terrestrial pollen grains. * Late Paleocene (Lower Ha zone) - Frequent Apectodinium augustum * Early - Middle Jurassic - Nannoceratopsis This type of palynological assemblage with allochtonous material derived from Middle IIa or Lower IIa zones is generally developed in the Upper IIa sequence. Accordingly, the occurrence of the Diatom Coscinociiscus sp . at 2200-2210m could also be the result of reworking- 10 - 2.2.4 - 2254.70m (SWC) - Middle Ila zone - Early Eocene Positive palynological evidence of the Middle ha zone is encountered at 2254.70m in light grey shale sample. This interval is characterized by the consistent occurrence of the Diatom Coscinodiscus sp. 1. This may suggest the presence of the Middle ha zone but the presence of the Lower ha zone cannot be excluded. The lack of palynological data prevents accurate assignment of the ciinocyst zonation. 2.2.6 - Interval 2Z20/30m - 2340/50m - Late Paleocene The benthic Foraminifera Spiroplectammina spectabilis first downhole appears at 2220/30m. This occurrence may alternatively suggest the presence of Lower IIa (base) and/or Ib zones. As in the preceecting interval, accurate assignment of the dinocyst zonation cannot be made. 2.2.7 - 2352m-2389m - Ia3 zone - Late Paleocene E -C .2, Palynological Ia3 evidence occurs at 2352m (SWC) and 2389m (SWC) - Rich assemblage including Paleoperkiinium pyrophorum, Eisenackia crassitabulata, Paleocystodinium benjamini and Deflandrea striata D.207... have been observed in shale samples. Agglutinated foraminifera (Hormosina ovulum gigantea assemblage) predominates through this interval. Radiolaria influx is marked at the base of the Ia3 palynozone (2380/90m cutting sample). The significant downhole appearance of the planktonic foraminifera Planorotalites compressus and Morozovella pseudobulloides marksthe top of Early Paleocene series at 2400/410m. Microfauna is dominated by planktonic foraminifera ( . comp res sus , M. pseudobulloides and M. varians ) through the interval 2400 /410m to 2580/90m. A The Ia2 palynozone has been clearly identified in three side wall core samples at 2439m, 2527m and 2531m. The rich palynological assemblage is mainly characterized by Alisocysta reticulata and Spiniferites sp. 996. The base of the Early Paleocene has been fixed at 2580 /90m on micropaleontological data. There is no evidence for Ia2 palynozone between 2531 and 2590m. The WC sample analysed at 2565 appears to be devoid of any paiynomorphs. The absence of Early Paleocene palynozone older than la2 indicates that the boundary between the Paleocene and the Cretaceous is Unconformable 2.3 - interval 2840.50m to 2895m - Upper Cretaceous Three sidewall core samples have been analysed through this interval. This sample contains rich marine assemblage of Campanian age mainly including Odontochitina striatoperforata, Chatangiella victo- riensis, Heliodinium voigti and Paleoperidinium pyrophorum. Some Early Cretaceous reworkings (Gochteodinia villosa) are to be noted. 2.3.2 - 2886m-2895m - Early Senonian to Turonian These two SW samples yield extremely abundant dinofiagellates mainly including DinoDterygium cladoides , Surculosphaeridium- 12 longifurcatum, Stephodinium coronatum, Exochosphaeridium bifidum (abundant at 2895m), Achomosphaera ramulifera... together with other long ranging species. The two samples have been assigned to an Early Senonian Turonian age. 2.4 - Interval 2917m to 3349m - Jurassic 2.4.1 - 2917m - 2922m (core 1) - NJ7 zone - Middle Kimmeridoian 2938.50m - 2950m (SWC) NJ7 zone _arobablv The three core samples are well characterized and show abundance of terrestrial and marine microplankton. The palynofacies includes significant amounts of clear and unaltered amorphous sapropel. The dinocyst assemblage significantly includes Oigosphaeridium pulcherrimum D. 585, Glossodinium dimorphum, Egmontodinium polyplacophorum, Gonyaulacysta gigas, Senoniasphaera jurassica and Tubotuberella apatela. The two sidewall core samples at 2938.50m and 2950m contain extremely abundant amorphous sapropel while the microf1ora appears to be markedly impoverished. 2.4.2 - 2972m (SWC) - NJ6a - Early Kimmeridglan The 2972 sample corresponds to homogeneous grey black shale. The zone can be distinguished by the occurrence of Scrinicdinium crystallinum and Hystrichogonyaulax cladophora. The terrestrial elements dominate the palynological assemblage and strong alteration affects the whole organic microfossils. Black ligneous material and brown amorphous particles are also observed.- 13 - 2.4.3 - 2980-2953m - NJ5a zone - Early Middle Callovian The three sidew all core samples examined correspond to grey black homogeneous shales, sometimes coaly and micaceous (2983m). The zone is accurately marked by major change in the composition of the marine assemblage which includes Korystocysta norrisii, Wanaea accolaris and Nannoceratopsis pellucida . The sudden explosion or bloom of K. norrisii is particularly noticeable at 2983m and the fossil record appears to be monospecific at this level. The assemblage is dominated by terrestrial elements in which the frequency of Callialasporites dampieri is to be noted. The organic material is once again affected by strong alteration and fragmentation. Heterogeneous ligneous material and brown amorphous debris are also observed. 2.4.4 - 2994.5-3056.5m - NJ4b1 zone - Early Bathonian 8 core samples have been analysed within this interval, all of them being rich to very rich. Terrestrial palynomorphs are always predominant ekcept at 3028.5m. They are characterized by high values of Gymnosperm pollen (Bisaccates and other Gymnosperms in about equal proportions ) and frequent large Cerebropollenites mesozoicus Other Gymnosperms occur in low frequencies : Perinopollenites elatoides ( quite abundant at 3001 and 3056.5m), Callialasporites dampieri, Classopollis spp., Araucariacites australis Spores which never exceed 24 % of total assemblages are widely dominated by Cyathidites, Retitriletes and Csmondacidites.I I. Marine microplankton frequently occurs throughout this interval, reaching up to 25 % of the total assemblages at 3049m and 60 % at 3038.25m, but is extremely poorly diversified. Only one or two species, close to the Chytroeisphaeridia/Batiacasphaera complex have been recognized, associated with scarce acritarchs. The palynofacies is composed of terrestrial and coaly debris with sporadic cuticles and quite constant traces of amorphous organic matter. 2.4.5 - 3061-3094m - NJ3a4 zone - Late Toarcian This interval is characterized in very rich samples (2 core samples, SWC), by abundant terrestrial palynomorphs occurring together with quite scarce but diversified microplankton. Terrestrial microflora contains Chasmatosporites (mainly C. major) in abundance comparatively with the previous interval and still abundant, but not predominant, bisaccate pollen. Other Gymno- sperms are poorly represented. Spores remain infrequent and mainly dominated by Cyathidites and Osmondacklites. Marine assemblages are never abundant but relatively diversified and characterize the NJ3a4 zone. The dinocyst assemblages include representatives of the Parvocysta group (P. bullula, P.sp.B), several Nannoceratopsis species (N. senex, gracilis , N. triceras, .D912, .D914) , Luehndea spinosa (predominant at 3078m) and Mancodinium semitabulatum. The palynofacies is quite diversified and made up of miscellaneous charcoal, wood and plant debris with some amorphous organic- 15 - 2.4.5 - 3125.5-3190m - NJ3a1 zone - Early Pliensbachian 6 SWC samples yielding very rich homogeneous terrestrial microflora have been taken in this interval. The assemblages are constanly dominated by bisaccate pollen (60-70 % of total assemblages) with frequent large forms. Other Gymnosperms are frequent and very diversified. The spore spectrum is typically dominated by Osmundaceae which frequently makes up more than 60 % of the total spores. Marine organisms are only represented by very rare Acritarchs at 3155.50m. Botryococcus algal colonies are frequent in the uppermost part of the interval. Such strongly continental assemblages characterized by high frequencies of Bisaccate pollen and abundant Osmundaceae associated with exclusively ligneous and vegetal palynofacies are quite characteristic of Early Pliensbachian (NJ3a1 zone) of North Sea. 2.4.7 - 3212-3220.5m - Uncharacterized 2 samples have been analysed within this interval. They yield abundant but not diagnostic microflora. Numerous Dinocysts occurring at 3212 have been referred to K. norrisii and probably represent Middle Jurassic cavings. Occurrence of Ovalipollis and Limbosporites lundbladi, in the same sample, must be attributed to Rhaetian reworkings. 2.4.8 - 3238.3m - 3289m - NJ2 zone - Sinemurian 12 fossiliferous samples have been analysed within this interval. They all yield predominant or exclusive terrestrial palynomorphs. Bisaccate pollen are the most abundant (24 to 60 % of total assem- blages) with Perinopollenites which reaches up to 40 % of totalassemblage in the upper part of the interval. The increase of Monosulcites sp and Eucomiidites (E. troedssonii and E. granulosus) from below 3280m is stratigraphically significant event. Other pollen are Chasmatosporites spp. (more abundant in the lower part of the interval), Classopollis sp.p. (more abundant in the upper part), Cerebropollenites (C. mesozoicus, C. thiergartii) and Quadraeculina anellaeformis (small and large forms). Spore spectrum is widely dominated by smooth trilete close to the Cyathiclites/Deltoispora group. Marine organisms, few Acritarchs and particularly the diagnostic dinocyst Liaskiium variabile, have been recovered in the upper part of the interval. Such monospecific amounts of Liasidium variabile (up to 30 % of total assemblage at 3250m) followed by an increase of Eucomiidites and NIonosulcites enables the 1\1;12 succession to be subdivided in Late and Early Sinemurian respec- The palynofacies strongly fluctuates throughout the interval. Charcoal are predominant at 3250m whilst structured dark woods constitute 90 % of organic residue at 3268m. Amorphous organic matter is not usual component of the palynofacies. 2.4.9 - 3334.5-3349m - NJ1 zone - Hettanzian The zone has been defined on SWC samples, very close together with regards to both microflora and palynofacies. The microflora is exclusively of terrestrial origin. Compared with the previous assemblages Bisaccate Pollen and Perinopollenites conspicuously decrease while Chasmatosporites and Spores increase in the same proportion. Spores are widely dominated by smooth trilete (Cyathidites group). The main other Spores are Gsmundacidites sp.p. , Contignisporites problematicus, Trilites sp. and Stereisporitesantiquasporites. Only few specimen of the diagnostic Trachy- sporites fuscus have been found at 3149m but an Hettangian age for the whole of this homogeneous interval is probable. The palynofacies is constantly made up of abundant brownish to black particles, sometimes showing wood structures, and few large plant debris. 2.5 - Interval 3362m to 3392m - Late Triassic (Rhaetian) 4 samples have been analysed in this interval. Most of them are rich or very rich but abundant pollutions have been observed between 3362 and 3386.7m. Diagnostic Rhaetian palynomorphs have been recorded, Limbospo- rites lundbladi (frequent) and Rhaetipollis germanicus (rare), from below 3362m. Ovalipollis ovalis makes its first downwards appearance at 3292.5m, where it is abundant and associated with predominant monosulcate pollen.3 - CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSILS 3.1 - Introduction Calcareous Nannofossils have been studied on 73 ditch cutting samples spaced every 20m between 620m and 1090m and every 30m or 40m between 1100m and 2920m. The nannoplankton is generally well represented in the Tertiary series and allows biozonation to be proposed. Early Miocene, Late and Early Oligocene, Early Eocene and Early Paleocene have been characterized between 620m and 2580m. The chalk deposits contain impoverished assemblage of Late Senonian age. Zonations mentioned are those of MARTINI, 1971 (Zones NN for Neogene and NP for Paleogene). 3.2 - Zonation Distribution of species is plotted on Plate and the major associations are described hereafter : . 620m to 880m : poor.

A detailed subdivision of the Tertiary series has been established. Paleocene are accurately characterized. The recovery of Nannofossils is poor through the chalk deposits and late Senonian age could only be proposed. * - PERCH-NIELSEN, K. (1985) - Mesozoic Calcareous Nannofossils - in BOW, H., SAUNr-ERS, J.B. & PERCH-NIELSEN, K. : Plankton Stratigraphy, 329-426, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge.I   4 - CONCLUSIONS (Plates - - - 8) A detailed and integrated biostratigraphical subdivision of Late Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary series from well 25/5-1 has been established using micropaleontological and palynological criteria, and supplemented by nannofossil data for Cretaceous and Tertiary. Late Triassic deposits The oldest sediments encountered are of late Triassic (Rhaetian) age between 3392m SWC and 3362m SWC. The abundant microflora appears to be exclusively land derived. Jurassic deposits Jurassic deposits have been identified between 3349m and 2917m. Early Jurassic deposits (3349m SWC - 3061m Core 5) They range through Hettangian, Sinemurian, Early and Late Pliensbachian, and Late Toarcian. Early Toarcian deposits cannot be differentiated, probably resulting from sidewall core sample coverage. The Early Jurassic sequence appears to be continuously represented although minor intra-early Jurassic breaks cannot be totally excluded. Microplanktonic assemblage continues to display high land-derived influences through Hettangian and Sinemurian deposits. Marine conditions are considered in Late Sinemurian (NJ2b palynozone). Marine dinoflagellates tend to be reduced both in specific and generic diversity, with the species Liasidium variabile dominating. Pliensbachian assemblage (Naal palynozone) corresponds to high development of Gymnosperm bisaccate pollen and Pteridophyte- 25 - spores. Significant amounts of large plant debris are recovered together with ligneous material. Ostracods indicates an outer marine environment. Abundant Botryococcus algal colonies are locally encountered. Toarcian sediments (NJ3a4 palynozone) point to relative diversification of the marine assemblage. Marine conditions, with strong terrestrial influences are considered. Late Toarcian deposits (top 3361m core 5) appear to be unconfor- mably overlain by Early Bathonian deposits (base 3056.50m core). Middle Jurassic (Early Bathonian) deposits (3056.50-2994.50m cores to 5) The boundary between Toarcian (NJ3a4 palynozone) and Early Bathonian (NJ4a1 palynozone) corresponds to sharp palynolo- gical break. The NJ4a1 marine assemblage is characterized by the over- abundance of cysts related to Chytroeisphaeridia/Batiacasphaera complex of boreal affinity. The low diversity pattern of the NJ4b1 zone is quite similar to that of the NJ2 zone in Late Sinemurian interval. Large terrestrial influences with Gymnosperm pollen predominating are indicated. Unconformity separates Early Bathonian deposits (top 2994.50m core 2) and Early Middle Callovian deposits (base 2983m SWC). Late Jurassic deposits - 2983(SWC)-2917m (core 1) The marine argillaceous Late Jurassic sedimentation begins with thin Early - Middle Callovian deposits identified between 2983m SWC-2980SWC (NJ5a palynozone).- 26 - Callovian sediments appear to be uncorformably overlain by Early Kimmeridgian sediments (base 2972m SWC -NJ6a palynozone). The top of Middle Kimmeridgian unvestigated sediments (NJ7 palynozone) is fixed at 2917m core 1. Middle Kimmeridgian deposits are truncated by an unconformity separating Middle Kimmeridgian from Early Cretaceous deposits. The nature of the contact between Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits remains uncertain (see following paragraph). Cretaceous deposits (2900/910-2620m) At 2900-2910m (one cutting sample) the encountered microfauna characterizes Barremian, Aptian, Albian and Cenomanian sediments. Turonian - Early Senonian sediments are evidenced by Palynology at 2895m (SWC) and 2886m (SWC). This Cretaceous interval (Barremian to Turonian) appears to be highly condensed but complete, although intra-Cretaceous breaks cannot be completely ruled out. The absence of microfauna younger than Barremian indicates that the boundary between Jurassic and Cretaceous is unconfcrmable. The extent of uppermost Jurassic and Early Cretaceous missing cannot be exactly determined. Campanian to Maastrichtian age is indicated between 2840 /60m and 2620m by planktonic foraminifera and nannofossils. An outer neritic environment is considered. 7.-ie limit between Maastrichtian and Paleocene is suggested unconformable, with uppermost Maastrichtian and partly Early Eocene missing. Tertiary deposits Paleocene and Early Eocene deposits (2590-2010m) Integrated results in terms of palynozones (NTIa2., TIa3 , NTIb, Lower NTIIa , Middle NT ha, Upper NT Ha, NT IIb and NT IIc) are proposed on Plate 7.The top of Early Paleocene series is fixed at 2410m (Ia2 zone) and corresponds to an influx of planktonic foraminifera reflecting an outer neritic environment. Late Paleocene series (Ia3, Ib and Lower IIa zone) have been identified up to 2330m. The top of Paleocene is considered to correspond to the top of the Lower IIa zone. In well 25/5-1, the top of the Lower IIa zone cannot be accurately fixed, so the top of Paleocene is suggested at 2330m. Benthic agglutinating foraminifera (S. spectabilis) and Radiolaria occur in the Ia3-Ib interval indicating upper bathyal conditions. Early Eocene series (Middle IIa, Upper ha, IIb and Ilc zones) have been recognized up to 2010m even if the exact extent of palynozones cannot be accurately determined. Diatoms (Coscinociiscus) are predominantly represented, as usual, in the Middle IIa interval. Benthic and planktonic foraminifera become progressively dominant in the Upper ha, lib and 11c series indicating outer neritic to upper bathyal conditions. Middle and Late Eocene - Oligocene - Early Miocene deposits (1990-620m) The biostratigraphical subdivisions established in Middle Eocene (top 1790m), Late Eocene (top 1610m), Early Oligocene (top 1260m), Late Oligocene (top 900m) and Early Miocene (start of analysis at 620m) are the results of micropaleontological and nannofossil investigations. Foraminifera assemblage indicates environments ranging from upper bathyal to outer neritic.I. 10. 3050 PLATE : EP/S/EXR/Lab. No 88/140RP RKB 111)  3100 3150 PALYNOFACIES MOA/MOV /MOX+ MOB /M0B2/FOSS.
