Client: Spirit Energy Norge AS Field: Oda Well: 8/10-B-3 AH Survey type: Rig Source VSP and Walkaway VSP Company: Spirit Energy Norge AS Well: 8/10-B-3 AH Field: Oda Country: Norway Run: 1E Date: 29 Aug 2018 Recorded by: Alex Heynen, Vishal Talreja, Les Dallas, Zander Joiner, Odd and Duncan Wiles Witnessed by: Robin Greenly and Egisto Mannini Logging Date: 29-Aug-2018 PageJob Summary On 29th of August 2018 Rig Source VSP and Walkaway VSP surveys were carried out by Schlumberger Wireline for Spirit Energy Norge AS in the 8.5 open-hole and 5/8 cased-hole sections of 8/10-B-3 AH well drilled in the Oda field offshore Norway. A 28-level component Versatile Seismic Imager tool (VSI) was used to acquire all the downhole data. Triple G-Guns were deployed on the rig and Dual Delta 6-G-Guns were deployed from the vessel. The sources were controlled by TRISOR and positioned using SWINGS-3. The sources were positioned relative to the aft of the Skandi Saigon vessel using measured layback and digital fluxgate compass, to determine the vessel heading. The offshore supply vessel had adequate main engine and thruster power to hold location. It was also aided by DP system which was used to run the lines with high accuracy. pre-survey rig transit was performed and the SWINGS-3 coordinates accuracy was confirmed. For the ZVSP only the bottom tools were anchored in OH and then moved up couple of settings. Once in CH, all 28 tools were anchored to record three Walkaway lines and remaining ZVSP data. While running-in-hole, Checkshot was recorded with both rig and boat sources, with VSI-28 anchored over 2065.2-1653.7 MD. This was in-between the Walkaway line-2 & -3 depth intervals. The data quality was evaluated by Schlumberger and Spirit Energy in real-time (remote monitoring) and it was decided to shoot contingent lines-2 & -3 based on the coupling quality (only levels clearly affected by casing ringing over 8 MD). The ZVSP was recorded over 2860-175m MD, with 177 levels at spacing and overall good data quality over deviated section, while strong casing ringing affected most of the vertical hole where only checkshots could be time picked on horizontal geophones. Three Walkaway lines with km and over 300 shotpoints each, were recorded along the same N315deg path with the VSI-28 tools moving uphole with one level of overlap:  WA Line with 28 tools over 2960-2278mMD: good data quality for all shuttles and all shots  WA Line with 28 tools over 2278-1867mMD: levels with casing ringing, undetermined noise shows at random times in receiver gathers. Line had to be aborted because of rig requiring permit for boat to enter exclusion zone. When line resumed noise decreased.  WA Line with 28 tools over 1867-1455mMD: overall good coupling for all shuttles. Several shots affected by same noise as Line-2, but to less degree. At the end of line 17 shots were missing and 10 shots were reshot over clustered patch of missing shots. Good weather conditions (calm sea) were observed through the survey. Some missed shots (loosing communication with boat) together with some unexplained random-time downhole noise affecting shot records on lines and 3, slowed down the acquisition and the effective sailing speed was less than the initial knots planned. The data was transmitted via InterACT for rush data processing.SEQUENCE OF EVENTS (1/2) Wed 29th Aug 2018 7:00 AM 8/29/2018 Start safety meeting for run 1E. 7:15 AM 8/29/2018 Start rig up Run 1E. 8:33 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first shuttles. 9:18 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 14 shuttles; cannot power up 250V (straight going to more than 1mA); informed town. 9:15 AM 8/29/2018 Rigging down shuttles. 9:29 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 11 shuttles; cannot power up 250V (straight going to more than 1mA) 9:29 AM 8/29/2018 Changing out the bridle between the VSCC and top shuttle (one used for ops checking the tools). 9:35 AM 8/29/2018 Connecting new bridle/shuttle below VSCC to power up one shuttle. 9:39 AM 8/29/2018 Powering up one bridle/shuttle; works fine. 9:41 AM 8/29/2018 Taking out two more shuttles to have remaining in the hole. 9:53 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first shuttles; cannot power up 250V (straight going to more than 1mA). 10:03 AM 8/29/2018 Power up shuttles again; all okay; suspect shuttles and bridles or 9; continue rig up. 10:26 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 12 shuttles; 300mA. 10:39 AM 8/29/2018 Continue rigging up next shuttles. 10:55 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 16 shuttles; 329mA. 11:13 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 20 shuttles; 366mA. 11:32 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 20 shuttles; 394mA. 11:50 AM 8/29/2018 Power up first 20 shuttles; 424mA. 12:02 PM 8/29/2018 Connecting the VSCC, VSPC, etc. 12:22 PM 8/29/2018 Tool fully connected and powered up; rigging up the sheave wheels. 12:40 PM 8/29/2018 Tool zero at the bottom of the VSCC. 2:49 PM 8/29/2018 Firing first shots with the rig guns. 2:53 PM 8/29/2018 Switching to the boat guns. 3:02 PM 8/29/2018 Firing first shots with the boat guns. 3:07 PM 8/29/2018 Boat is currently 2685m from the rig. 3:37 PM 8/29/2018 Continue RIH. 4:03 PM 8/29/2018 Correlation log up from 2000m; +3.0m. 4:09 PM 8/29/2018 Correlation log up from 2010m; -0.2m. 4:14 PM 8/29/2018 Confirmation pass up from 2010m. 4:45 PM 8/29/2018 Start rig shooting for bottom shuttles. 5:16 PM 8/29/2018 Shuttle at 2753.6m is in washout, but data fine. 6:26 PM 8/29/2018 Boat starting approach WA line 1.
