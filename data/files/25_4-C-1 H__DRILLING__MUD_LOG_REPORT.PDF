The service commenced from the first spud on the 25th May 2001 and remained on contract for the duration of the well to TD at 4004 metres MD / metres TVD (RKB), on 2nd July 2001. The service was maintained throughout the completion logging and until 1/2 Liner was set. This report is intended as summary of the information and data collected, monitored and analysed as part of the service. The work was carried out by the following engineers, whose responsibility it was to provide an Applied Drilling Technology and Geological Engineering service.

The reserves are located in the Brent Group, mainly in the marginal marine Tarbert Formation. The well will be tied to the Heimdal platform. The well was spudded on the 25th May 2001, from the Scarabeo semi-submersible drilling rig. The drilling process took 39 days, utilising 12 drill bits, to reach total depth of 4004 metres MD/ metres TVD on the 2nd of July 2001. 36 Hole section 140 to 202 A 26 bit was run with 36 hole opener and MWD tool. The section was successfully drilled to TD using seawater and bentonite sweeps. The hole was in good condition and displaced to sg bentonite mud. 26 Hole section 202 to 1214 A 26 bit was run on Mud Motor and MWD tool. The bit drilled successfully to TD using seawater and viscous sweeps with returns going to the seabed. Four bit runs were needed due to top drive failure and restrictions in flow. At the end of the section the angle was degrees. The hole was displaced to sg bentonite mud. A 17 1/2 Smith bit was used to drill out the 20 shoe and of new formation using seawater. LOT was performed to sg. A 12 1/4 Smith PDC bit was run on mud motor and MWD tool. The hole was displaced to sg oil base mud and the bit drilled vertically to 1337 where the mud motor and the bit were lost in the hole. The well was plugged back into the 20 casing. Well 25/4-C-1-H T2 A new Smith TCI bit drilled out the cement and kicked off from 25/4-C-1 to 25/4- C-H T2 at 1219 m. The angle was built to 14 degrees, but the direction became difficult to control and the bit had to be pulled at 1653 m. A Smith milled tooth bit, hard faced continued the drilling and building of angle to 26 degrees. The bit was pulled at 2015 for planned bit change. A Smith PDC bit was run in and continued drilling mainly in rotary mode to maintain angle and direction. The bit entered the Rogaland Group where the sand is depleted causing high risk for differential sticking. When the bit drilled through the occasionally thin Claystone and Siltstone stringers, it was too aggressive for the formation resulting in the string to torque up and sometimes the bit was hanging up. That caused directional problems and the bit was pulled out.A rock bit was then run to drop the angle in the section above the Shetland group. The assembly experienced difficulty steering in the under pressured Heimdal formation and the penetration rate was low and after 37 hours on bottom it dropped to zero. Another rock bit of the same type as the previous one was run in order to drop the angle before the penetration of the Shetland limestone. In order to avoid fault the well was also steered to the west. The drilling rate was low in the hard formation and the low gas levels experienced reflect both this and the relatively high overbalance with which it was drilled. The final run of the section utilised PDC bit on rotary steerable assembly with an Anadrill PowerDrive tool. The tool was used to ensure that the near vertical well stayed on target, rather than for drilling deviated well. The section TD was called on cuttings returns, in claystone, below the massive Shetland limestone sequence. Rates of penetration were higher than with the preceding rock bits, but gas values remained low. The 10 3/4 / 5/8 casing was run without incident and minimal losses were observed during the cementing. A rotary assembly with PDC bit was used to drill out the 5/8 shoe and formation integrity test was carried out to 1.90sg after drilling 4m of new formation. The assembly did tend to build angle as the well was extended through the reservoir, but remained within target tolerances. ROPs were low in the hard formation and this eventually forced bit trip within 200m of the expected well TD. The same assembly with an extra stand of drill collars was used in the final run with different PDC bit to extend the well 165m to TD of 4004m MD (3909.2m TVD), which is approximately 174m below the base of the producing zone. The gas levels remained low in this run but the ROP improved in the Dunlin formation. Wireline logs were run at TD before running the 1/2 liner. The well was suspended and trawl protector installed on the well head pending production completion.36 Hole 26 Hole D e p t h m DAYS vs DEPTH HYDRO 25/4-C-1 25/4-C-1-H T2 25/4-C -1 HT2 KOP at Prognosed Actual 12 1/4 Hole 8 1/2 Hole 5 1/2 Liner set at 4003 mMd25/4 C HT2 LOGGING SERVICES SUPPLIED EQUIPMENT: TYPE OF SERVICE: Sperry-Sun INSITE System End of Well Report Real Time Drilling Monitors Sample Collection/Analysis Real Time Tripping Monitors Hydraulics Analysis CRT Data Displays Pore Pressure Evaluation Real Time Log Displays Computerized ADT Reporting IRIS Data Acquisition Server Formation Evaluation Log Windows NT Database Server Daily Data Reporting 5 Windows NT Work Stations Choke Pressure Drill floor / Pump Room Monitors Hookload and WOB HP Design Jet Plotter Mud Temperature in/out 2 FID Total Gas Detector Top Drive Rotary Speed FID Chromatograph Top Drive Torque 3 Office Monitors Stand Pipe Pressures H2S Detectors Pump Strokes and Flow Mud Weight in/out Mud Conductivity in/out Pits Volume and Total SAMPLE COLLECTION 25/4-C-1 / 25-4-C-1 T2 One litre wet bucket sample & 1220m to 2100m 20m interval One 0.5kg wet bagged sample 2100m to 3507m 10m interval 3507m to 3900m 5m interval Geochemical gas bag samples 3520m to 4000m 40m interval One litre mud samples were taken at the start and end of each hole section, at points of significant changes in the mud system and prior to running TD wireline logging.RIG EQUIPMENT DRILLING CONTRACTOR Saipem RIG NAME Scarabeo RIG TYPE Semi-Submersible DRAW WORKS Oilwell E-3000 ROTARY TABLE Oilwell 49 1/2 MUD PUMPS Oilwell A-1700-PT TOP DRIVE Maritime Hydraulics DDM-650 SOLIDS CONTROL EQUIPMENT SHAKERS Thule VSM 100 /Brandt Scalping DE-GASSER Wellco 5200 BOP DETAILS BOP EQUIPMENT Cameron 18-3/4 15k WELLHEAD KOS FMC CHOKE LINE Cameron DIVERTER Regan KFD DR1Hydro 25/4-C-1HT2 Geological discussion p.

Lithology description................................p.Hydro 25/4-C-1HT2 Geological discussion p. 10 Introduction Sperry-Sun began the sampling at the depth of 1220m MD (1220m TVD). litre bucket of unwashed cuttings (set B), one 1/2 litre of unwashed cuttings in bags for biostratigraphy (set A), and cuttings washed sample for examination at the wellsite, were taken every 20m MD from 1220m MD to 2100m MD, every 10m from 2100m MD to 3507m MD, every 5m from 3510m MD to 3900m, and every 10m set / 40m set to the total depth at 4004m. In addition, one litre bottle of mud were taken at the start of mudlogging in each section and at casing points or whenever major changes to the mud system. Further, one geochemical gas-bag sample were taken every 40 metre from 3520m MD to 4000m MD. Lithological analysis of the cuttings was conducted at the wellsite using binocular microscope and an ultraviolet light source. The interpreted lithology is based on cuttings-lithology and drilling parameters such as ROP, WOB, torque, gas levels and MWD-logs. Gas levels were recorded in percent using Total Hydrocarbon Analyser and were broken down into constituent components C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4 by Gas Chromatograph measuring in ppm. table of drilled gas peaks is given at the end of each section, giving background gas (BG) and gas peaks with component breakdown. Formation tops were picked by the Wellsite Geologist. table of prognosed and actual depths for formation tops is presented in figure 1.Hydro 25/4-C-1HT2 Geological discussion p. 11 Group Formation Prognosed Depth (m TVD) Actual Depth (m MD/TVD) Rogaland Balder 2245 2225 / Sele 2258 2243 / Hermod / Heimdal Vle 2732 2804 / Shetland Undifferentiated 2839 / Viking Undifferentiated 3604 3562 / 3468 Ness 3936 Dunlin Formation tops picked by the wellsite-geologist.Hydro 25/4-C-1HT2 Geological discussion p. 12 Lithology Description TOP HORDALAND GROUP: 1220  2225 MD / 1220  TVD This section consists of claystone with thick sandstone unit in the upper part, as well as interbeds of sandstone and limestone throughout the section.

The bit was mainly rotated with only short intervals of steering to maintain angle and direction. The average penetration rate for the hole run was m/hr. The pore pressure is decreasing over the interval and the Hermod sand, which has occasionally thin Claystone and Siltstone stringers, is depleted to an estimated pressure of sg. The bit was too aggressive and the torque increased as the bit drilled through the changing lithology. It also was hanging up occasionally. The toolface became difficult to control and the penetration rate dropped at the end of the run. When pulling out of the hole, 30 mtons overpull was seen pulling the first two stands. The background gas level was generally low. Bit No. Smith 15GMDPD, 12 1/4 bit, jets 22, Interval drilled 2640  2771 m, Drilled 311 m, Hours on bottom 38.2, Graded: not available This insert bit was run on the same directional assembly. Dropping the hole angle was priority in the section above the Shetland group. The assembly experienced difficulty steering and ROPs were low in both rotary and oriented drilling. The high overbalance whilst drilling the under pressured Heimdal formation was contributory to the poor performance. Gas levels remained low throughout the run and no connection gases were recorded. When pulling off bottom the jars were frequently operated, possibly as result of differential sticking, although ledges from the numerous limestone stringers is also conceivable. The bit was pulled after the ROP fell to zero and this was interpreted as being due to the bit having dulled. Bit No. Smith 15GMDPD, 12 1/4 bit, jets 1x22, 3x24, Interval drilled 2771  2933 m, Drilled 162 m, Hours on bottom 29.9, Graded: not available This insert rock bit of the same type as the previous one was run on the same directional assembly in order to ensure the correct hole angle for the penetration of the Shetland limestone. In order to avoid fault the well was also steered to the west. The drilling rate was low in the hard formation and the low gas levels experienced reflect both this and the relatively high overbalance with which it was drilled. No connection gases were observed.

This PDC bit was run on rotary steerable assembly with an Anadrill PowerDrive tool. The PowerDrive was used to ensure the vertical well remained on target, rather than for drilling deviated well. The bit achieved higher ROPs than the preceding rock bits.

Interval drilled formation: 3507  3839 m, drilled 332m, Hours on bottom formation: 43, Graded: 2-5-WT-A-X-I-BF-PR. This PDC bit was run on rotary assembly to extend the well through the reservoir section. The cement and shoe track was drilled in hours. The assembly did tend to build angle slightly, but remained within target tolerances. The reservoir was penetrated approximately 50m higher than prognosed. The gas values increased significantly in the reservoir section, with number of peaks. Some of these may be associated with thin coals noted in the cuttings. ROPs were generally low in the hard formation, dropping below m/hr at the end of the run and the decision was taken to pull the bit on this basis. Bit No. 12 Smith MA-74PX 1/2 bit, jets 1x16, 3x15, 2x12. Interval drilled formation: 3839m  4004m, drilled 165m, Hours on bottom formation: 12.1, Graded: 0-0-NO-A-X-I-NO-TD. This PDC bit was run on slightly modified rotary assembly from the previous run. stand of 1/2 drill collars having been added. The ROP was initially low but improved in the Dunlin formation. Gas levels remained low throughout. The MWD tool was run without radioactive sources on this run following technical difficulties at surface. TD for the well was called approximately 174m below the base of the production zone. The well was circulated clean and the bit pulled. Tight hole was experienced between 2700 and 2800m whilst pulling out of hole. The bit was run back to bottom and the hole circulated clean.

Connection gas can be used effectively as quantitative measurement as it is considered that its presence indicates that pore pressure is within 35 bar of the drilling fluids hydrostatic pressure. 2) Hole conditions: Tightness, drag and fill can be used as qualitative indications of abnormal pore pressure. 3) Cavings appearance: Spalling cavings is good indicator of higher pore pressure than the hydrostatic pressure from the drilling fluid. 4) Flow line temperature: A qualitative indicator which, can display rapid increases on entering over-pressured zones. 5) Modified Dc Exponent: The modified drilling exponent (Dxc) can be used to calculate pore pressures in claystones using Eaton's formula. Having established trend line for normal pore pressure, i.e. increasing with depth as the formation drillability decreases due to normal compaction, any cutbacks away from the trendline whilst drilling claystone indicate increasing pore pressure. It is important to note that Dc Exponent cannot be used to evaluate pore pressure when rate of penetration is being held back for hole cleaning purposes and is inappropriate for use in lithologies other than claystone.PORE PRESSURE EVALUATION WHILST DRILLING Please note that all depths are in TVD. PROGNOSIS Estimation based on data from correlation wells indicates normal pore pressure down to 1405 m. At 1405 the pore pressure is expected to increase from hydrostatic to sg at 1650 m. The pore pressure gradient then decreases through Hordaland towards hydrostatic at approximately 1900 m. Due to regional depletion one can expect subnormal pressure in Frigg and also in Heimdal sands if present. Any hydrocarbons present in these sands will be balanced by seawater if depleted. The pore pressure will increase gradually from hydrostatic at top Lista or possibly earlier, in mid to base Sele and reach approximately sg in top Shetland. A steady pressure of sg is expected through the Shetland Group. sharp increase to sg is expected at the transition Shetland / Viking groups. The Viking / Brent transition is also characterised by sharp change in the pore pressure gradient. Theoretically the pressure in top Brent can be as high as sg (621 bar) as maximum. The pore pressure gradient is expected to drop towards the OWC and be around  sg (646 bar) at TD. 36 HOLE SECTION The 36 section was drilled without any riser with seawater and high viscous sweeps in one bit run from 140 to 202 m. No problems were encountered drilling this section. The exponent was erratic in throughout this section, so normal compaction trend line could not be set, but there was no indication of anything other than normal pore pressure of sg. 26 HOLE SECTION The 26 section was drilled in bit runs from 202 to 1214 m. The section was drilled with no returns to surface with seawater and viscous sweeps. The exponent was erratic in throught this section, so normal compaction trend line could not be set, but there was no indication of anything other than normal pore pressure of sg. 12 1/4 HOLE SECTION A 17 1/2 bit drilled out the cement, shoe and of new formation using seawater. LOT was performed to sg. The bottom hole assembly was changed to 12 1/4. The hole was displaced to sg Versa Vert oil based mud and the first bit drilled to 1336m, but was left in the hole. sidetrack was drilled in bitruns to 3413 mTVD. In the Hordaland Group the formation drilled consists of silty claystone and sand. The Rogaland Group consists of mainly sand with claystone stringers, and the Shetland Group consists of Limestone and calcerious claystone. The variations in formation resulted in erratic exponent indicating no trend. Gas levels were low with no connection gas and cavings. The increase of drilled gas at 3330 resulted from change in the formation. 8 1/2 HOLE SECTION The formations encountered in this hole section prevented the accurate establishment of normal D- exponent compaction trend for pressure prediction. No pressure cavings were observed during the drilling of the section. Gas peaks that were thought to be connection gas were investigated by performing pumps- off and swab tests. No gas peaks resulted. These peaks were attributed to minor coals picked from the cuttings analysis. The mud weight was raised from sg to sg in anticipation of the reservoir being penetrated 50m higher than prognosed. The reservoir formation pressure, as determined from the TD wireline logging was sg.25/4-C-1 H, Norsk Hydro Sperry-Sun Drilling Services Hydro 25/4-C-1 INSITE RUN NUMBERS AND RANGES RULES: Actual drilling runs are numbered by hundreds e.g. 0100, 0200 Casing runs are numbered by fifties e.g. 0150, 0250 Wiper trips / runs without MWD are tens e.g. 0410, 0460 Re-log wipes or odd occurrences on same bit run are hundreds plus one e.g. 0101, 0201 INSITE RUN BIT no OPERATION SUMMARY DEPTHS LOGGING Date/time From/to (use Time SDL fast for range) COMMENTS 0100 Rig move and anchor handling 140  202 23/05/01 15:50:59 TD in one run 27/05/01 11:35:02 0200 Drill 26 hole 202  269 27/05/01 11:35:02 Pulled bit to repair top drive 28/05/01 18:43:16 0300 2RR Drill 26 hole 269  527 28/05/01 18:43:16 Pulled bit to change motor 29/05/01 23:36:56 after restricted circulation 0400 2RR2 Drill 26 hole 29/05/01 23:36:56 Pulled bit to repair top drive 31/05/01 08:43:32 0401 na Repair top drive 31/05/01 08:48:35 Repair top drive 02/06/01 00:38:33 03/06/01 13:24:38 05/06/01 08:38:06 06/06/01 13:00:35 07/06/01 16:56:32 08/06/01 03:10:23 08/06/01 13:27:03 09/06/01 14:27:13 09/06/01 16:01:56 11/06/01 23:08:09 13/06/01 13:22:07 15/06/01 10:37:11 18/06/01 07:58:29 21/06/01 09:41:19 24/06/01 14:49.20 27/06/01 07:01:53Hookload (metric tons) Hydro 25/4-C-1 H, 26 Hole Torque & Drag Plot Depth (m) Torque (kN-m) Hookload Up WT (mton) Hookload Dwn Wt (mton) Hkload Free WT (mton) Free TRQ (kNm)Hydro 25/4-C-1-H T2, 12 1/4 Hole Torque & Drag PlotHydro 25/4 -C -1-H T2, 1/2 Hole Torque & Drag Plot - tric tons) .
