INTRODUCTION: This report is part of qualitative and quantitative palynological analysis of the Paleocene and Early Eocene interval of samples from wells of the Balder Field. The Phase of this study includes the 25/11-11 to 25/11-13. This study is primarily based on analysis of core and side wall core samples. When needed cutting samples may exceptionally be used. The EPR.E Cenozoic palynological zonation (see EPR.E.SS.87; fig. 3.2; by R. JAN DU CHENE, M. PONS & D. MICHOUX) is used as basic framework to subdivide the intervals studied and to corellate the wells included in this project. The finest subdivisions proposed in these reports are based on quantitative distribution of organic microfossils; their value is certainly restricted to the area studied or to part of this area. When possible minimum of 300 organic microfossils were counted per sample. In this report the ratio or percentages of organic microfossils type or species are always expressed with regard to the total of the organic microfossils counted in the sample, unless precised. STRATIGRAPHIC RESULTS: A total of 28 side wall core samples of the well 25/11-13 were palynologically analysed in the Early Eocene to Early Paleocene interval between 1678 and 1910m. Most of these samples are rich to very rich in organic microfossils. These allow the definition of succession of assemblages or associations which are tentatively correlated with those found in the nearby wells 25/11-12, 25/11-5 and 25/11-11 (see SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND CORRELATIONS).PALYNOZONE III: Deflandrea oebisfeldensis 1 m. Two of three major associations designed as reference in the well 25/11-12 report are observed in this palynozone. None of the species caracterising the uppermost part of Palynozone III are recorded in the samples studied, particularly Thalassiphora pelagica and Eatonicvsta ursulae, index species of the Association A. From the top to the base of the palynozone, we recorded: B) Disaccate type pollens association Assemblage with frequent Deflandrea oebisfeldensis and abundant Disaccate type pollens (1678-1684m). Specimens from other species of pollens and spores are extremely rare. C) Inaperturopollenites hiatus association Acme of Inaperturopollenites hiatus (Taxodiaceae) (1695m) in an assemblage in which the pollens and spores species increase in In this last association we note the following succession of events: -. First occurence of Compositoipollenites rizophorus (1695m). -. First occurence of Ptermospermella sp. (1713m). -. First occurence of Alnipollenites sp. (1754m). -. Presence of reworked Palaeoperidinium pvrophorum (1757m) in an abundant and relatively dark continental biodegraded organic matter. -. Presence of Impletosphaeridium sp. cf. I. severinii (1760m).- PALYNOZONE II: Apectodinium homomorphum This palynozone is generally caracterised by an abundant amorphous or terrestrial biodegraded humic organic matter. Its top is defined by the first occurence of Apectodinium augustum. This species is first recorded at 1767mm together with abundant Apectodinium spp. This genus is unknown in strata older than the base of NP9 (or extremely rare in the top of NP8 for some authors). As already noted in the well 25/11-11 and 25/11-9, small pollen types such as Carvapollenites spp. and other triporate types are also abundant in this Palynozone, Inaperturopollenites hiatus and the Disaccate type being less frequent that in the lower part of Palynozone III. The following succession of associations is recorded: A) Senegalinium sp. association First occurence of Apectodinium augustum together with abundant Senecialinium sp. and highly diversified spore and pollen assemblage (1767m). B) Foveasporites sp. association b) Association with abundant Apectodinium spp., Disaccate type pollens and Foveosporites sp. Small Tricolporopollenites and porate species are also abundant (1784-1809m). C) Reevesia sp. association First and regular occurence of Reevesia sp. and abundant Spinidinium densispinatum (1818-1819m). PALYNOZONE IB: Allsocvsta crassitabulata This palynozone is generally caracterised by dark lignitic and/or coaly organic matter debris. Spiniferate cysts and Disaccate type pollens are almost always abundant. The diversity of the spores and pollens is very low. Areolioera senonensis shows series of 'acme' peaks. Palynozone 1B corresponds to the RRI zone PP4. Eight major associations (A to H) were defined to subdivide this palynozone in the well 25/11-12 (Table 1). They are used as reference for tentative correlations with the other wells studied in this project.- 4- TABLE Major components and index species of the eight associations defined in the Alisocysta crassitabulata Palynozone of the well 25/11-12.

B. In the well 25/11-13, the samples studied in the upper part of Palynozone IB (1823-1842m) are caracterised by very irregular values of Areoligera senonensis with peak abundances at 1825m (10%) and 1833m (9%). In the same interval, Impaoldinium sp. is frequent to very abundant with maximum at 1835m (22%). Finally, the presence of frequent Cometodinium balderi, noted in previous wells at the top of Association A, is not recorded in this well. The following succession is proposed: A) Spiniferate cysts association. This association is essentially caracterised by abundant Spiniferate cysts and Disaccate type pollens. Areolioera senonensis is rare or absent. The sample 1823m is tentatively attributed to this association. B) Areoligera senonensis first acme association. Association with frequent to abundant Spiniferate cysts, Areoligera senonensis, Disaccate type pollens and increasing values of Impaoidinium sp. B.Meanwhile the samples attributed to Association (1825-1833m) are caracterised by very irregular values of Areoliqera senonensis with weak peak abundances at 1825m (10%) and 1833m (9%). C) Impaqidinium sp. association Association with frequent to abundant Spiniferate cysts, Impaqidinium sp. and Disaccate type pollens, and rare Areoliqera senonensis (1835m). Rare occurences of Impaqidinium sp. are also recorded and may suggest Association D. D) Impaqidinium sp. association Association with frequent to abundant Spiniferate cysts and Disaccate type pollens, and rare Impaqidinium sp. B, Impaqidinium sp. and Areoliqera senonensis (1842m). Rare occurences of Impaqidinium sp. are also recorded at 1833 and 1835 and may suggest Association at these levels. E) Areoliqera senonensis second acme association The abundance of Areoliqera senonensis at 1844 and 1848m together with the low frequence or absence of Impaqidinium sp. and Impaqidinium sp. strongly suggest that the Areoliqera senonensis second acme association is reached. Incertae sedis sp. is not recorded in this interval as well as the index species caracterising the associations F, or H. PALYNOZONE IA2: Palaeoperidinium pvrophorum 1873 m. This palynozone is recorded in single sample (1873m). The association is rich in Disaccate type pollens and P. pvrophorum. PALYNOZONE IAl: Alisocvsta reticulata 1910 m. This palynozone is recorded in single sample at 1910m. The association is rich in Disaccate type pollens and Deflandrea striata.SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND CORRELATIONS: In this study, we correlate the first occurences of the index species with those recorded on the cycle chart of HAQ et al., 1987 as on Fig. of the Report EPR-E.7SS.87 by R. JAN DU CHENE, M. PONS & D.MICHOUX. Of course these results have to be compared with well log analysis and results of the Seismic analysis. From the top of the Early Eocene to the base of the Paleocene, the correlations between diagnostic species first occurences and the sequence chronostratigraphy are: Top Palynozone III: Deflandrea oebisfeldensis Below 49.5m.y. may be below 50m.y. Top Palynozone II: Apectodinium auoustum Below Top Palynozone IB: Alisocvsta crassitabulata Below Top Palynozone IA2: Paleoperidinium pvroPhorum Below Top Palynozone 1A1: Alisocvsta reticulata Below 61 Top Palynozone IAO: Senoniasphaera inornata Below 63 Depth: 1678m. Age: Early Eocene. Sequence stratigraphy: Below 49.5. Palynozone III: Deflandrea oebisfeldensis. Association and comments: The presence of frequent specimens of the index species Deflandrea oebisfeldensis indicates thAT Palynozone III is already reached at this depth. The palynological association is strongly dominated by Disaccate type pollens (59%). Taxodiaceae and Carya type are very rarely recorded. The dinos are relatively abundant (40% of the total assemblage) but badly preserved, many of them being non determinable at the specific level. Spiniferites spp. (8%), Hvstrichosphaeridium tubiferum (7%), Glaphvrocvsta spp. (4%) and Deflandrea denticulata (2%) are frequent. The presence of rare specimens of Trichodinium sp. and Kissselovia tenuivirpula allows correlations with the samples 1679m in the well 25/11-12.Depth: 1684m. Another sample in which the palynological assemblage is strongly dominated by Disaccate type pollens (68%). Taxodiaceae and Carya type are still very rarely recorded. The generally badly preserved dinos are relatively abundant (30%) but often difficult to determine at the specific level. Spiniferites spp. (17%), Hvstrichosphaeridium tubiferum (4%), Deflandrea oebisfeldensis (4%) are still frequent but Glaphyrocvsta spp. and Deflandrea denticulata are rarely recorded. Trichodinium sp. and K. tenuiviraula are not recorded in this sample which is tentatively correlated with the level 1842.5m in the well 25/11-5. Depth: 1695m. This sample is caracterised by the high diversity of the pollen assemblage (top or in ?PP5c of RRI) and the abundance of Inaperturopollenites hiatus (Taxodiaceae type) which reaches 61%. Relatively frequent Retitricolporites spp. (8%), Retitricolpites spp. (2%) and Intratriporopollenites pseudinstructus (2%), rare Triatriopollenites roboratus and Compositoipollenites rhizophorus are recorded. Meanwhile an abundant amorphous or continental biodegraded organic matter makes the observation and the determination of many of these small pollens difficult. The abundance of I. hiatus defines the top of Association C. Depth: 1707m. The palynomorphs are generally badly preserved and many dinos (13%) are difficult to determine at the generic level.Deflandrea oebisfeldensis (13%), Spiniferites spp. (9%) and Glaphvrocvsta spp. (6%) are frequent in assemblage dominated by Disaccate type pollens (30%). Depth: 1710m. This sample is caracterised by abundant Carvapollenites trianqulus and C. circulus (15% together), Inaperturopollenites hiatus (Taxodiaceae type) (28%) and Disaccate type pollens (38%). The dino Senegalinium sp. is also relatively frequent (5%). Very rare occurences of the pollens cf. Vacuopollis sp. and Triatriopollenites sp. cf. T. intermedius are also first recorded at this level. Depth: 1713m. This sample is also caracterised by an abundance of Carvapollenites trianqulus and C. circulus (7% together), Inaperturopollenites hiatus (Taxodiaceae type) (44%) and Disaccate type pollens (7%). The dinoflagellate assemblage is dominated by the frequent occurences of Deflandrea oebisfeldensis (10%) and Glaphvrocvsta spp. (7%). Very rare specimens of the pollen Basopollis sp. (which may be reworked) and of the algae Ptermospermella sp. (?top of PP5b of RRI) are first recorded at this level. The abundant amorphous or continental biodegraded organic matter found in this sample also caracterises this PP5b (RRI) subzone. Depth: 1720m. A relatively poor sample without any precise stratigraphic signification.- - Depth: 1727m. trianqulus and C, circulus (13% together), Inaperturopollenites hiatus (Taxodiaceae type) (47%) and Disaccate type pollens (14%). The dinoflagellate assemblage is dominated by Deflandrea oebisfeldensis (3%). Ptermospermella sp. (algae) and relatively frequent Leiosphaeridia spp. (3% together) are recorded at this level in an abundant amorphous or continental biodegraded organic matter. They caracterise the PP5b (RRI) subzone. Depth: 1745m. A palynological assemblage strongly dominated by Disaccate type pollens (58%) and poor dinos association caracterises this sample. Inaperturopollenites hiatus (Taxodiaceae) (20%) and masses of small Tricolporopollenites spp. (5%) and Tricolpopollenites spp. (12%) are also frequently recorded. Ptermospermella and Leiosphaeridia spp. are more rare at this level than above. Very poor dinoflagellates assemblages are also recorded at 1734m in the well 25/11-12, at in the well 25/11-5, and at 1721m in the well 25/11-11. Depth: 1746m. Another rich sample strongly dominated by continental palynomorphs such as Inaperturopollenites dubius (56%), Disaccate type pollens (13%) and Carvapollenites spp. (11%). Small Tricolporopollenites spp. and Tricolpopollenites spp. are also frequent. Ptermospermella and Leiosphaeridia spp. are rare. The first occurence of Triatriopollenites platvcarvoides is recorded here.- 10 - Depth: 1754m. Another sample strongly dominated by continental palynomorphs such as Inaperturopollenites dubius (49%), Disaccate type pollens (21%) and Carvapollenites spp. (7%). Small Tricolporopollenites spp. and Tricolpopollenites spp. are also frequently recorded. This sample is caracterised by the first occurence of Alnipollenites sp. and Palaeocvstodinium sp. cf. P. deflandrei. Alnipollenites sp. is first recorded at 1745m in the well 25/11-12, Depth: 1757m. The same association, strongly dominated by continental palynomorphs such as Inaperturopollenites dubius (45%), Disaccate type pollens (20%) and Carvapollenites spp. (6%), is recorded at this level. Small Tricolporopollenites spp. and Tricolpopollenites spp. are frequent. Alnipollenites sp. is also present here. Depth: 1760m. Inaperturopollenites dubius (59%) and small Tricolpopollenites spp. and Tricolporopollenites spp. (19% together) are very abundant at this level. Alnipollenites sp. is still recorded as well as relatively frequent Impletosphaeridium sp. cf. I. severinii. The single specimen of Aquilapollenites sp. is considered as reworked. The same reworked taxon is found at 1730m in the well 25/11-11.PALYNOZONE II: Apectodinium homomorphum Depth: 1767m. Age: Late Paleocene. Sequence stratigraphy: Below 53.5. Palynozone II: Apectodinium augustum. This sample is caracterised by an abundant amorphous or terrestrial biodegraded humic organic matter. It makes the observation and the determination of many of the palynomorphs difficult. Meanwhile we note the first occurence of Apectodinium augustum together with abundant Senegalinium sp., Apectodinium spp. and highly diversified assemblage of spores and pollens. Depth: 1784m. This sample is essentially caracterised by the concurent occurences of Alisocvsta margarita and abundant Apectodinium spp. We also record the first occurences of Spiniferites sp. cf. S. rhomboideus and Foveosporites sp. and the occurences of Areoligera senonensis and Spiniferites spp. The assemblage is dominated by Disaccates type pollens. Depth: 1809m. This sample is caracterised by abundant Apectodinium spp. We also rhomboideus and Foveasporites sp., and relatively frequent Areoligera senonensis and Spiniferites spp. The pollen and spore assemblage is dominated by the Disaccates, small Tricolporopollenites spp. and porate species.- 12- Depth: 1818m. Palynozone II: Apectodinium auqustum. record very abundant Apectodinium spp. with A. auqustum, A. parvum, A. quinquelatum together with frequent Spinidinium densispinatum and the first occurence of Reevesiapollenites sp. A. Depth: 1819m. This sample is also caracterised by an abundant amorphous or terrestrial biodegraded humic organic matter which makes difficult the observation and the determination of many of the palynomorphs. Meanwhile we record very abundant Apectodinium spp. with A. auqustum together with frequent small Tricolporopollenites spp., Tricolpopollenites spp. and porate pollen species. We also note the regular presence of Reevesiapollenites sp. A. PALYNOZONE IB: Alisocvsta crassitabulata Depth: 1823m. Age: Late to Middle Paleocene. Sequence stratigraphy: Below 55.5. Palynozone: Alisocvsta crassitabulata Although no index species are recorded in the sample, the palynofacies together with the abundant Disaccate type pollens and Spiniferites spp. suggest Palynozone IB.- 13- Depth: 1825m. Palynozone IB: Alisocvsta crassitabulata. Specimens determined as Alisocvsta sp. and Alisocvsta crassitabulata are recorded in this sample together with abundant Disaccate type pollens (58%), Spiniferate cysts (24%) and Areoligera senonensis (10%). This last species seems to show the top of its first acme at this level. Depth: 1830m. This sample is caracterised by the first occurence of rare Impagidinium sp. and by the abundance of Disaccate type pollens (40%), the frequence of Spiniferate cysts (20%) and the last downhole occurence of Apectodinium spp. If the specimens of this last genus are not considered as mud pollution, they indicate that this level still belongs to the base of the nannozone NP 9. Depth: 1833m. A very rich sample caracterised by abundant Spiniferate cysts (29% with maximum of Spiniferites ramosus subsp. granosus; 18%), Deflandrea denticulata (12%), Areoligera senonensis (9%) and Impagidinium sp. (8%). The pollen association is composed essentially of Disaccate type pollens (28% of the total assemblage). The index species Allsocvsta crassitabulata is also frequent (5%). This sample is tentatively correlated with the levels 1782-1783m of the well 25/11-12.- 14- Depth: 1835m. This sample is also caracterised by abundant Spiniferate cysts (55%) and Impagidinium sp. (22%). Areoliaera senonensis is rare (1%). The pollen association is still composed essentially of Disaccate type pollens (11% of the total assemblage). Very rare specimens of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum are present. They are considered as reworked. This sample is tentatively correlated with the levels 1783-1784m of Depth: 1842m. Palynozone IB: Alisocysta crassitabulata. Two types of palynomorphs are extremely frequent at this level: the Spiniferate cysts (62%) and the Disaccate type pollens (24%). Impaaldinium sp. is much rarer (1%) and Areoliaera senonensis is slightly more frequent (3%) than in the overlying sample . This sample may correspond to the level 1839m in the well 25/11-12. Depth: 1844m. Association and comments: The association is composed essentially of three types of palynomorphs: the Spiniferate cysts (37%), Areoligera senonensis (21%) and the Disaccate type pollens (36%). Impaaidinium sp. is rare (1%). This sample corresponds to the top of the Areollaera senonensis second acme. It is recorded at 1854m in the well 25/11-12.- 15- Depth: 1848m. The association recorded in this sample is similar to the one above with 36% of Spiniferate cysts, 31% of Areoligera senonensis and 22% of Disaccate type pollens. This sample corresponds to the level 1858.5m in the well 25/11-12. Depth: 1857m. Age: Paleocene. Sequence stratigraphy: Indeterminate. Palynozone: Indeterminate. Mud pollutions and indeterminable palynomorphs. Depth: 1865m. PALYNOZONE IA2: Palaeoperidinium pvrophorum Depth: 1873m. Age: Middle to Early Paleocene. Sequence stratigraphy: 58.5. Palynozone IA2: Palaeoperidinium pvrophorum.- 16- The first occurences of Palaeocvstodinium benJaminii and Deflandrea striata together with frequent Palaeocvstodinium bvrobhorum and abundant Disaccate type pollens caracterise this sample.

Palynozone IAl: Allsocvsta reticulata. Alisocvsta reticulata first occurs at this level in an assemblage stongly dominated by Deflandrea striata (47%) and the Disaccate type pollens (37%).- 17- APPENDIX PALYNOLOGICAL SUBDIVISIONS IN THE EARLY EOCENE AND IN THE PALEOCENE OF THE WELL 25/11-13- 18- ii !
