The plan is to drill one hole section, 2610m long, where the last 625m are in the reservoir followed by holeopening run. Sperry-Sun Drilling Services provided directional surveys throughout the well and in the first run when setting the whipstock. Additional Gamma Ray, Electromagnetic Wave Resistivity, Compensated Neutron Porosity, Pressure While Drilling, Bat-Sonic and Azimutal Density were provided in the last 875m of the section (last 725m for the Azimutal Density). Directional and Pressure While Drilling sensors were utilized in the holeopening run.Summary of MWD runs Run Bit Hole MWD No. No. Size Sensors (in) Start End Drill/Wipe Depth Depth Distance (m) (m) (m) Run Start Run End Date Time Date Time BRT Oper.

Stop drilling at around 4000 meters and run gyro as planned. Description of Failure The GYRO showed consistent 2.5-degree higher azimuth reading compared with the MWD tool. Drilling commenced to TD well of 4900m MD, with the same MWD tool, but factor of degrees was added to the MWD azimuth. Action Taken 2.5 degrees added on the MWD azimuth when drilling the well to TD below the gyro run.Run new Suvey tool in run 300 that confirmed the GYRO data . Operation Impact None Reason for Failure DM SN:168289 had been damaged by excessive vibration and/or shock, causing the B/G misalignment error. The logs from AB-MW-02001 has been looked at, no significant vibration seen. After this the DM was sent to Norway, and passed QC/verification in the cave before being sent to this job. Then it was first used in run 0100 together with NR03553H6 to set Whipstock at 2291m and mill hole to 2293m, we do not have any vibration data from that run. No significant vibration seen in the logs from run 0200.
