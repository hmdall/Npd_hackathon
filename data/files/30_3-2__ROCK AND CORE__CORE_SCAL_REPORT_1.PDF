From each of the whole core pieces, three one and half inch diameter core plug samples were drilled using brine consisting of approximately 30,000 ppm sodium chloride. Five of these samples were scheduled for fresh-state analysis, and these were stored under the brine prior to analysis. The remaining samples, including the thirty plug samples sent by Statoil were cleaned in hot refluxing methanol followed by xylene and then methanol once more. They were dried in humidity controlled oven and air permea- bility and helium injection porosity were then measured. Please note that samples numbered and 1A fractured and could not undergo further analysis. All samples used in this study are described with respect to depth and lithology on pages through of this report. Formation Factor and Resistivity Index Data (Page 9) Fifteen samples, labelled 1A to 15A were scheduled to undergo this analysis. The clean, dry samples were evacuated and pressure saturated with simulated formation brines consisting of approximately 33,000 ppm sodium chloride and was synthesised according to information furnished for use in this study. copy of this analysis is presented on page 8. Electrical resistivities of the remaining brine saturated samples and saturant brine were measured on consecutive days until results stabilised indicating ionic equilibrium within the core samples. Formation resistivity factors were calculated and results are presented in tabular form on pages through 11 and in graphical form on page 12. With an intercept 'a' value of unity the cementation exponent 'm' value is 1.79. During air-brine capillary pressure measurements, while the samples were removed from the cell, their resistivity was measured at each equilibrium saturation. Resistivity indices were calculated and results are presented in tabular form on pages through 11 and in graphical form on pages 13 through 26. The saturation exponent 'n' values vary from to with an average of 1.82. Cont'd.............UKSCAL 311-82072 Formation Factor at Different Brine Concentrations Data (Page 27) The clean, dry samples were evacuated and pressure saturated with brine consisting of approximately 75,000 ppm sodium chloride. Please note that sample number depth metres fractured and was unsuitable for further analysis. tabular form on pages 27 through 30 and in graphical form on page 31. The samples were each then mounted in hydraulic core holder and were flushed with brine consisting of approximately 33,000 ppm sodium chloride. The resistivity of the effluent was monitored and when the 75,000 ppm brine had been displaced, electrical resistivities of the samples were again measured. When stable reading had been obtained the process was repeated using brine consisting of approximately 20,000 ppm sodium chloride followed by one of 5,000 ppm sodium chloride. Results are presented in tabular form on pages 27 through 30 and in graphical form on pages 31 through 34. With intercept 'a' values of unity the cementation exponent 'm' values are 1.82, 1.79, and for the 75,000 ppm, 33,000 ppm, 20,000 ppm and 5,000 ppm brines respectively. Formation Resistivity Factor as Function of Overburden Pressure Data (Page 35) Following the above analyses, the thirteen samples were leached in hot methanol and dried in humidity controlled oven. Air permeability and helium injection porosity were then remeasured. The clean, dry samples were evacuated and pressure saturated with the 33,000 ppm sodium chloride brine. Electrical resistivities of the brine saturated samples and saturant brine were measured on consecutive days until results stabilised indicating ionic equilibrium within the core samples. The samples were then each mounted in hydraulic core holder and their resistivities were measured at effective overburden pressures of 13.6 bars, 50 bars, 100 bars, 150 bars and 200 bars. constant internal pore pressure of bars was maintained throughout and reductions in pore volumes with each increase in sleeve pressure were monitored by measurement of brine displacement from the samples.tabular form on pages 35 and 36 and in graphical form on pages 37 through 42. With an intercept 'a' value of unity, the cementation exponent 'm' value varied from at bars effective overburden pressure to at 200 bars effective overburden pressure. Air-Brine Capillary Pressure Data (Page 43) This analysis was performed in conjunction with formation factor and resis- tivity index measurements on fourteen samples labelled 2A to 15A. Following formation resistivity factor at room conditions measurements, the fully saturated samples were placed in porous plate cell and humidified nitrogen introduced at increasing incremental pressures from bars to 2.0 bars. Equlibrium saturations were determined gravimetrically with the samples removed from the cell. Results are presented in tabular form on page 43 and in graphical form on pages 44 through 56. Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure Data (Page 57) Ten samples, three from the upper reservoir and seven from the lower reservoir were scheduled to undergo this analysis. The clean, dry samples were each placed in chamber of mercury and injected at increasing incremental pressures from psia to 2000 psia (136 bars). Mercury injected (non-wetting phase) saturations were converted to wetting phase saturations. Results are presented in tabular form on pages 57 and 58 and in graphical form on pages 59 through 68. Water Permeability as Function of Overburden Pressure Data (Page 69) This analysis was performed in conjunction with formation factor as function of overburden pressure measurements on the thirteen samples labelled 2A to 15A. Following remeasurement of formation factors at room conditions, each fully saturated sample was mounted in hydraulic core holder and the resistivity was measured at effective overburden pressures of bars, 50 bars, 100 bars, 150 bars and 200 bars. At each pressure, permeability to the brine was measured. Results are presented in tabular form on page 69.-iv- Specific Permeability to Water Data (Page 70) Ten samples labelled 16A to 20A and 16B to 208 were scheduled to undergo this analysis. The clean, dry samples were evacuated and pressure saturated with the 33,000 ppm sodium chloride brine. They were each then each mounted in hydraulic core holder and were flushed with this brine to ensure the removal of any trapped gas, permeability to this brine was then measured. Results are presented in tabular form on page 70. Gas-Oil Relative Permeability Data (Page 71) Following specific water permeability analysis, five samples labelled 16A to 20A were placed in high pressure porous plate cell and desaturated. They were each then mounted in hydraulic core holder and flushed with depolarised degassed kerosene to ensure the removal of all mobile water and trapped gas. Any water displaced was recorded and initial water satura- tions calculated. Effective permeability to this oil was then measured. Gas-oil relative permeability measurements were performed using humidified nitrogen as the displacing phase. Incremental volumes of oil and gas pro- duced were recorded against time and the floods were terminated at gas-oil relative permeability ratios in excess of 30. Relative permeability data were calculated using digital computer and results are presented in tabular form on pages 71 through 75 and in graphical form on pages 76 through 85. Please note that it was requested that back pressure of 20 bars be maintained throughout this test, however this was not possible. Waterflood Susceptibility Data (Page 86) Following specific water permeability measurements the five samples labelled 168 to 208 were placed in high pressure porous plate cell and were desaturated. refined mineral oil having the viscosity of approximately centipoise at room conditions. This gives an oil :water viscosity ratio of in the laboratory, which is similar to that in the reservoir. Water displaced was recorded and initial water saturations calculated. Effective permeability to this oil was then measured. Waterfloods were performed using the 33,000 ppm sodium chloride brine as the displacing phase, at flow rate of approximately 400 ccs/hrs. Incre- mental productions of oil and water were recorded against time and the floods were terminated at water cuts in excess of 99.9%.-v- Statoil Results are summarised on page 86 presented in tabular form on pages 87 through 91 and in graphical form on pages 92 through 96. From this data water-oil relative permeability were calculated using digital computer and results are presented in tabular form on pages 108 through 112 and in graphical form on pages 113 through 122. Following these fast rate floods, initial conditions were re-established by flushiftg the samples with refined mineral oil having viscosity of approximately 20 centipoise at room conditions. Water out was recorded and initial water saturations were calculated. The samples were then flushed with the low viscostty refined mineral oil. When the heavy oil had been displaced, effective permeability to the low viscosity oil was remeasured. Waterfloods were performed as before but at flow rate of approximately 4cc/hr for throughput of approximately pore volumes. Results are summarised on page 97, presented in tabular form on pages 98 through 102 and in graphical form on pages 103 through 107. Relative permeability data were to be calculated from the slow rate waterflood susceptibility results. However, there were insufficient data points available for this to be possible. Residual Gas Data (Page 123) Five samples labelled 16A to 20A, were scheduled to undergo this analysis. These samples had previously undergone gas-oil relative permeability measurements. The samples were each suspended from balance under depolarised, degassed kerosene and the weight change, due to imbibition, monitored as function of time. Residual gas saturations were determined from plot of weight versus time at point on the curve, indicated by change in shape, where diffusion processes are at minimum. Results are presented in tabular form on page 123. Air Permeability at Differential Pressures Data (Page 124) Thirty samples were scheduled to undergo this analysis, however samples numbered 1, 1A and 12 were fractured and no further analysis was possible. The clean, dry samples were mounted in hydraulic core holder. Gas was flowed through each samples, the volume of which was measured using wet test meter. Upstream and downstream pressures were gauged using liquid monimeter. Air permeabilities were measured at four differential pressures and the results are presented in tabular form on pages 124 through 126. Please note that due to low permeability values it was not possible to obtain reasonable data for samples numbered 3, 3A, 7, 7A, 13, 13A, 15 and 15A. Cont'd..........-vi- Wettability Determinations by Imbibition and Dynamic Displacement Data (Page 127) Five, fresh state samples labelled 16 to 20 were scheduled to undergo this analysis. The samples were each mounted in hydraulic core holder and were flushed with the 33,000 ppm sodium chloride brine to ensure the removal of any trapped gas. Effective permeability to this brine was then measured. They were then immersed in deactivated, degassed kerosene for period of weeks until static imbibition of the kerosene ceased. The volume of oil imbibed, indicated by the volume of brine displace, was recorded. The plugs were then flushed with kerosene and the volume of brine displaced, indicating the volume of kerosene imbibed recorded. Effective permeability to the kerosene was then measured. The procedure was repeated using synthetic formation brine as the imbibing fluid. Wettability indices were calculated using the volumes of fluid statically and dynamically imbibed. The samples were then cleaned in Dean-Stark type distillation apparatus, leached in methanol and dried in humidity controlled oven. Air permeability and helium injection porosity were measured and fluid saturations calculated using material balance equations. Results are presented in tabular form on page 127. Samples numbered 16, 17, 18 and 19 all show tendancy to be wet by water, sample number 20 shows tendancy to be wet by oil. Rock Compressibility Data (Page 128) Fifteen samples numbered to 15 were scheduled to undergo this analysis, however samples numbered 1, and 12 were fractured and could not undergo The remaining clean, dry samples were each mounted in heat shrinkable plastic tubing, placed in hydraulic core holder, then saturated with brine consisting of approximately 30,000 ppm sodium chloride. The external sleeve pressure and internal pore pressure were raised simultaneously to approximately 218 bars and 204 bars respectively. Having reached pressure stabilisation, the internal pore pressure was reduced incrementally to simulate reservoir depletion and corresponding pore volume reductions recorded. Cont'd........UKSCAL 311-81072 Compressibilities were calculated from plot of pore volume versus effective overburden pressure and, from the curve, the instantaneous change in pore volume per unit overburden was determined. The resulting compressibilities were corrected for uniaxial loading as per Teeuw 1. The results are presented in tabular form on pages 128 through 139 and in graphical form on pages 140 through 151. Uniaxial loading conditions transformed from hydrostatic data as per Teeuw, Dirk: Prediction of Formation Compaction from Laboratory Compressibility Data.
