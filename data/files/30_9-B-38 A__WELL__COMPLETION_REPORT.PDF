Objectives and Results The main objective of Well 30/9-B-38 was to improve drainage and accelerate oil production from Upper Ness (UN1 zone) and Lower Ness 3-5 (LN3-5 zone) in the western part of the Gamma South structure (Figure A-1). secondary objective was to evaluate the potential of the ORENL2 reservoir in the toe section. The objectives were achived. Operations Summary Reentry operations on Well 30/9-B-38 started on the 31st of January 2000. pack stock was set in the pre-installed 95/8 casing of B-38, and B-38 was kicked off by milling window in the casing in the interval 2 MD. The well was kicked off in the Shetland Group, and an 81/2 hole was drilled into the Ness Formation and landed according to the plan. Due to unexpected pressure build-up, the formation was exposed to an ECD of max sg, and return was lost as result of fractured formation. Several attempts to heal lost circulation were performed without success. TD for B-38 was set 5831 MD / 2678 TVD, and the hole was plugged back for subsequent sidetrack. B-38 AT2 was kicked off in the Shetland Group at 4674 MD / 2515 TVD on the 21st of February 2000. The 81/2 hole was drilled into the Heather Formation at 5293 MD / 2613 TVD, reached on the 25th of February. The string packed off and stalled out at several depths, and due to severe hole stability problems the hole was plugged back on the 2nd of March 2000 for subsequent sidetrack higher up in the well. The operations on B-38 started on the 14th of March 2000. The well was kicked off below the pre-installed 185/8 casing in B-38 at 1180 MD / 983 TVD. 171/2 hole was drilled to 3487 MD / 2135 TVD, and the 133/8 casing set at 3486 MD / 2134 TVD. The 121/4 hole was drilled to 5583 MD / 2662 TVD in the Upper Ness channel sand, and the 95/8 casing was run with the shoe at 5582 m MD / 2661 TVD. subhorizontal 81/2 section was drilled to TD for the well at 7082 MD / 2824 TVD in the Dunlin Group, reached on the 27th of April 2000. The liner was run to 6870 MD / 2755 TVD in the Lower Ness LN3-5 zone.A-4 The well was completed with Camco-Schlumberger remote zone control system. 3 zones seperated with packers were installed, and the well was put on stream on the 20th of May with an initial oil rate of 2400 Sm3/day. Time spent on B-38 A/B measures up to total of 110 days, in which 77 days were used on the successful well B-38 versus 76 days budget. Installation of the Camco completion system was finalized approximately days ahead of plan.A-5 -B-1A1 -1T2B-16A Figure A-1: Structural Depth Map at Top Ness Fm, UN1, showing drilled wellsA-6 2 GEOPHYSICAL EVALUATION Well Results The depth and position of formation tops compared with prognosis for well B-38 A, B-38 AT2 and B-38 are listed in Table A-1 and Table A-2. Seismic profiles from the 3D amplitude cube and the acoustic impedance cube along the B-38 well track are given in Figures A-2 and A-3, respectively. The discrepancy between prognosed (adjusted to the drilled location) and actual depths of formation tops at reservoir level are more or less within the estimated uncertainty range, indicating that the seismic interpretation is fairly accurate in the area and that most of the discrepancy is caused by the velocity estimation in the depth conversion. The Base Brent in the toe end of the 30/9-B-38 at 7029 MD, was found 20 shallower than prognosed. This indicates that the interpretation needs some adjustment in this area. Above the reservoir, the drilled formation tops for 30/9-B-38 are consistently shallower than prognosed. This indicates that too low velocities have been used in the time-to-depth conversion for these horizons. At reservoir level, the seismic data quality along the first 2/3 of the horizontal section is considered to be fairly good, as indicated in Figure A-2. However, pronounced deterioration is observed towards the toe end, especially for the Base Brent reflector. This is probably related to degradation of reservoir sands in the Oseberg Formation towards south on the Gamma South Structure. Generally, in the Oseberg Field, low acoustic impedance values (green to blue colours on the seismic profile, Figure A-3) are indicative of sand. In the area of well Experience from drilling of 30/9-B-38 indicate high degree of correlation between low acoustic impedance intervals and sandy sequences. Depth maps for Top and Base Brent with the B-38 / B-38 AT2 / B-38 well paths projected is shown as Figure A-4 and Figure A-5, respectively.A-7 Surface Result MD TVD RKB TVD MSL Prognosis at drilled location Uncertainty MD TVD RKB TVD MSL TVD Variance TVD Grid Easting Grid Northing B.

A 1087 long subhorizontal section was drilled in Upper Ness (Figure A-6). Channel sand was penetrated as planned. Due to risk of hole stability problems in the last part of the horizontal section it was decided not to drill to Target #5. The well path was dropped into Lower Ness 3-5 at Target #4, and ~10 thick LN4 channel sand was penetrated. The well path was dropped into ORELN2, no sand was penetreted in this part of the well, and it was concluded that there is no reservoir potential in these reservoir zones in this part of the Gamma South structure, which excluded drilling of the planned B-39 sidetrack. B-38 is perforated in Upper Ness and Lower Ness 3-5, and the total length of perforation is 814 m. The well was completed with remote zone control (Table A-5, Figure A-7). Table A-5.

The methodology employed in the evaluation is also summarized. All depths quoted in this section are in MD RKB unless otherwise stated. Log Data Both wells were logged by Baker Hughes Inteq MWD employing their Multiple Propagation Resistivity (MPR), Dual Propagation Resistivity (DPR), Modular Density Lithology (MDL) and Modular Neutron Porosity (MNP). 30/9-B-38 - Log Quality and Corrections Table A-6: Logging Operations, 30/9-B-38 Run number Tool combination Interval MD Bit size Inch Date The log quality in Well 30/9-B-38 is bad due to lack of neutron and density memory data. Due to intermittent loss of transmission there are frequent gaps in the neutron and density real time data and the sampling rate are lower than the gamma ray and resistivity memory data.  Interval 8 was logged 23 hrs after drilling.  Memory data for neutron and density were not available from run #3 due to equipment failure. Real time data were spliced in over the interval 6 m. The data have been bridged over the missing intervals. Summary - missing data / real time data: Instrument Real time data interval (m MD) Neutron/density 6 The well was drilled with oil - based mud (Versavert).A-19 Table A-7: Logging Operations, 30/9-B-38 The log quality in well 30/9-B-38 is good. Data are missing in only one section. The 121/4 hole section was extended into Brent, thus density and neutron were not logged in the top part of Brent (Tarbert, UN2, upper part of UN1). Tool problems occurred at the following depths:  Intermittent MWD failure - Run 2, Missing GR 0  The interval 1 was relogged due to AutoTrack failure - no data lost  The resitivity transmitter on the RNT sub failed at 5262 (run 5). Resistivity data from transmitter are obtained from 5262 to 5433 m. Data from tra nsmitter 2 were pseudo-compensated over this interval by applying the same amount of compensation as was applied prior to the transmitter failure.  Neither density nor neutron data were aquired in the 121/4 section. Summary - missing data: Instrument Missing data interval (m MD) Gamma Ray 0 The well was drilled with oil based mud (Versavert) in all sections.A-20 Evaluation Method The reservoir intervals in B-38 and B-38 have been analysed using the Sands Log Analysis module in Recall supplied by Baker Atlas GEOscience. Environmental corrections other than real time borehole corrections applied by the field engineer were not applied to the data. The parameters used to perform the petrophysical evaluations are presented in Table A-8, Table A-9, and Table A-12. The petrophysical evaluation of the well was based on the results and methology developed in Oseberg Petrophysical Field Review 1999-2000 (Norsk Hydro 2000) (Ref /4.1/). Porosity The total porosity was calculated from the Density log. Grain density and fluid density values used in the calculation were zonal dependent. Zonal grain density values and zonal fluid density values are based on core analysis from cored wells. The effective porosity was calculated from the equation: PHIe = PHIt - (Vsh PHIshale) where PHIshale: Shale volume Shale volume was calculated using the GR Larionov method. Min. and Max. values for gamma ray were picked from log response for each subzone. Water saturation Effective water saturation Swe has been estimated using the Poupon-Leveaux equation (Indonesia) after correcting the porosity for shale effect. Total water saturation Swt has been estimated using the Dual Water equation. Formation water resistivity Rw used in the calculations is field value based primarily from well 30/9-2 water samples (Ref. /4.2/). Formation temperature was implemented according to the three areal temperature- depth relationships documented in the Oseberg Production Technology Design Basis, (Ref /4.3/). Coal sections were predicted by discrimation (density<2.10 g/cc, Neutron>0.35 frac). Additional editing was necessary. Calcite sections were predicted manually. In these sections porosity was set to and water saturation to 1. The equations of shale volume, porosity, water saturation and formation temperature are presented in Oseberg Petrophysical Field Review 1999-2000 (Norsk Hydro 2000) (Ref /4.1/). Permeability Permeability Kh was calculated from Artificial Neural Nets (ANN) developed by the Norsk Hydro F-senter Bergen, in cooperation with NTNU Trondheim (Ref. /4.4/). MWD data GR, deep resistvity, neutron and density were input to the calculation.A-21 Definition of Net Reservoir Net reservoir (curve: NETSAND) was defined by shale indicator Vsh less than or equal to 40%, and total porosity equal to or higher than the selected porosity cut-off value for each individual formation. The cut off values was derived from cross plotting overburden corrected core porosity and klinkenberg corrected core permeability Kh for each formation. The porosity cut off values were defined from the mD intersection point with the regression line. The cut-off values are presented in Table A-8. TABLE A-8: PHIt CUT-OFF VALUES, 30/9-B-38 A/B Tarbert Ness Etive Rannoch Oseberg PHIt cut-off Intervals less than were filtered out from the net sand flag curve Petrophysical Results Tables A-10 - A-15 present the average petrophysical result for 30/9-B-38 A/B. Gross TVD is measured as absolute difference in TVD between the top and bottom measured depth of zone. The average petrohysical result were calculated by the following methodology. Average standard petrophysical computed quantities were calculated over intervals that met the net reservoir criteria (Netsand flag equals 1). PHI Efficient porosity PHIe was input to the average porosity PHI calculation. Average porosity PHI was calculated arithmetic thickness-weighted. Sw Input to the average water saturation Sw, was the efficient water saturation Swe. Average water saturation Sw was calculated arithmetic thickness and porosity weighted. Kh Permeability estimate from artificial neural net was input to the average permeability calculation. Average permeability was calculated arithmetic thickness-weighted. The resulting CPI evaluation plots are presented in Figures 8-10.A-22 Summary 30/9-B-38 TABLE A-9: COMPUTATION PARAMETERS, 30/9-B-38 Parameter Symbol Unit Sources Tarbert Ness Formation temp. deg equation Depth of fm.temp. mTVDMSL Formation oil density RHOoil g/cm3 calculated Form. water dens.

Retrieved the BPV prong, BPV and bridge plug. Pulled the tubing out of the PBR and displaced the mud to 1,45 sg. Pulled the tubing, sat bridge plug at 4239 MD and pressure tested same. Installed new tubing head, high pressure riser and BOP. Sat packstock and milled window in 5/8 casing from 4228 to 4232 MD, and drilled 18 new formation to 4250 MD. 1.2 Drilling of B-38 8 1/2 section: Drilled 17 before the MWD tool failed. Changed the AutoTrak and Tripple Combo and drilled to 5831 MD, where the circulation was lost. Were not able to establish circulation with LCM material or cement plug on bottom. Could not determine where the loss zone was, so the well was plugged back to 4519 MD with three cement plugs. 8 1/2 section (T2): The first AutoTrak failed pulsing at the test at 1000 MD. Changed the AutoTrak and hit soft cement at 4519 MD. Washed down to 4536 MD and drilled cement to 4559 MD. Tried to sidetrack, but succeeded first at 4674 MD due to soft cement and limestone stringers. Kicked off and drilled to 5269 MD where the string went stuck. Got free and drilled to 5293 MD before the string went stuck again at 5283 MD when backreaming the stand. After 10 hours of jarring and working the string up and down it came free and was pulled out. Ran in the hole with new AutoTrak when the drillstring packed off at 4562 MD. Had to pull out of the hole because of the significant hole cleaning problem and ran into the hole with cleanout assembly. Reamed down from 4260 MD to 4670 MD where the string packed of and got stuck. The attemt to clean the hole was not successful. Due to the increasing hole stability problem and the amount of hole left to drill, it was decided to abondon B-38 and drill the well from below the 18 5/8 casing shoe. The string was pulled out of the hole after cleaning the plug setting area. The wireline running tool and bridgeplug and got stuck at 1933 MD. Left the running tool and plug and pulled out the wire. Plugged back to 1645 MD with cement plug. Cleaned the hole and scraped the bridgeplug setting area from 1440 to 1460 MD. 1.3 Reentry of B-38 Sat bridgeplug with pipe at 1450 MD, and cut the 5/8 casing at 1405 MD with casing cutter. Released the casing from the wellhead and retrieved same. Sat cement plug from 1405 - 1250 MD.B-8 Cut the 13 3/8 casing at 1175 MD and retrieved same. Milled the13 3/8 casing from 6 MD. Reamed the same interval with 17 1/2 flatbottom mill. Performed cleanout run with flatbottom mill and junkbasket to 1216 MD. Sat kickoff plug from 1215 MD and 61 into the 18 5/8 casing. 1.4 Drilling of B-38 17 1/2 section: Drilled cement with motor from 1215 MD and sidetracked from 1180 to 1220 MD. Drilled to 2241 MD before the MWD, motor and bit and were changed due to excessive wear that caused drop tendency during drilling. Continued to drill rest of the section (to 3487 MD). Lost the circulation while attempting to circulate prior to the cement job. Ran 13 3/8 casing to of bottom. Performed the planned emergency casing hang off. Ran into the hole with stinger and squeezed cement up to 3373 MD. 12 1/4 section: Drilled cement from 3363 MD and formation from 3487 to 4600 MD. Got washout in the standpipe in the pump room, and did wiper trip up to 3469 MD. Repaired the washout and drilled to 4888 MD. Changed the Autotrac due to hydraulic failure and drilled 33 before the AutoTrak stopped pulsing. Drilled with a new AutoTrak to 5438 MD before the pulsing stopped again. Drill the rest of the section to 5583 MD with fourth AutoTrak and new bit. Performed wipertrip and ran the 5/8 liner to bottom with drillpipe. Cemented the liner up to 3908 MD after overcoming airsupply problems, and sat the ZXP packer. Drilled cement from 5534 MD and formation to 6505 MD. Performed wipertrip to 6104 MD, and changed the washpipe. Drilled to 7082 MD and did a new wipertrip to 5267 MD. Circulated the hole clean at 6620 MD after overcoming problems with the drillstring packing off. Ran the liner with drillpipe to 6700 MD, and rotated it down to 6870 MD due to tight area. Cemented the liner without mud return, and sat liner packer. Ran in the hole with 5/8 cleanout assembly, and pressure tested the casing to 280 bar. Ran in the hole and landed the 5/8 10 3/4 tieback casing at 3341 MD and installed same. Nippled down and installed the tubing head.B-9 2 DOWN TIME REPORT2000-08-15 Downtimereport B-38 130:10, Reentry Well RepHours # Date Downtime Type Short Description Nsfi Type Equipment Type Service Type 30/9-B-38 16 2000-02-03 19:30:00 Equipment failure Circulated while troubleshoot on brake-PLS on the toodrive.

The well is sub-horizontal oil producer in the Gamma South Ness Fm, UN-1 and LN 3-5. The completion was successful first well installation of Schlumberger-Camco TRFC-H hydraulic operated zonal control equipment. Independent, adjustable flow control of three reservoir intervals is obtained by the subject completion. The completion operations started by displacing the well to completion fluid, perforate and new clean-up to scrape the packer setting areas. Followed by running, landing and testing of the completion string, including three TRFC-H devices, and landing and testing of the christmas tree. All depths given in the report are measured from the rotary kelly bushing (RKB) on the Oseberg B-platform, which is 58 above MSL.DRILLERS DEPTH, RKB B-PLATFORM mMD-RKB mTVD-RKB (Tie back point) Top of cement in annulus between 5/8 csg. and 12 1/4 hole : 3908 2318 Top of liner PBR : 5440 2626 Max TD achived during this job : 6819 2805Average hole angle through the Gamma South formation : 85 Max. hole angle : 91 deg at 6294 mMD-RKB Initial reservoir temperature at perforations : 116 deg.0 at 2800mTVD-RKB Fracture gradient in the reservoir (for vertical well) : s.g.

The completion concists of ea isolation packers with an inflow control device /choke (TRFC-H) inside liner with tubing between, and ea 5/8 production packer in 5/8 csg with and 1/2 tubing below down to the liner. Above the production packer the completion continues with pressure and temperature gauge, tubing and 1/2 DHSV. Main completion components: - Baker 1/2 TSM-5 TRSCSSV - Roxar pressure and temperature gauge - 5/8 QMP production packer - 1/2 TRFC-H - 31/2 sliding sleeve (back-up in case the TRFC-H fails) - QMP isolation packer - 1/2 sliding sleeve (back-up in case the TRFC-H fails) - Setting depth for the lower isolation packer - Setting depth for the upper isolation packer - Setting depth for the 5/8 production packer - Setting depth for the permanent pressure & temperature gauge - Setting depth for the TSM-5 TRSCSSV : 6678 MD : 6001 MD : 3647 MD : 3615 MD : 253 MD A standard fire resistent 3/8 FMC christmas tree is installed on the tubing head. Technical documentation of the tubing head and the christmas tree can be found in the FMC Installation Report, located in the Well Operations file. Prior to running of the completion string the well was displaced to completion fluid: Type : NaCI brine Density : 1,15 s.g. Type of inhibitor : KD-40 (0,4 vol%) Type of friction reducer: : ECF 561 (1 vol/0)The tests were done with s.g. brine in the tubing and annulus except as noted. Test pressure of production packer Pressure test tubing Annulus test pressure (LTO in tubing) (9 5/8 csg./7 prod. tubing) Test pressure of control line to TRSCSSV's Pressure test BPV plug from above Body test of christmas tree (closed wing and kill valves) Connection test Differential test pressure of lower/upper master valve and swab valve from below Pressure :280 bar/10 min Date 20.05.00 : Tested according to programme : Tested according to programmeThe completion operations started by washing the liner and 5/8 csg., set killpill to 5009 MD (witout string in hole) and displaced to 1,15 sg brine above. Used MFCT (Multi function Circulation Tool) to get higher rate in 5/8 casing, and that worked very well. Perforated the liner with 1/2 TCP guns on DP. Lost approx. m3, teoretical los to guns was 4,5 m3. When pulling out the guns 73 was lost in hole, that consisted of the bottom gun section and the x-over to drillpipe. Run in with an overshot and fished out the lost guns. Could not see any damage on the drillpipe or the x-over that could explain why the pipe got loos. Run in with clean-up assy. # 2. Scraped the packer setting areas on the way in. At TD pumped two hi-vis pills separated by brine pill to displace out the killpill and brine, and replace it with new killpill and brine. Used the MFCT on this run also, and got good return of dirt with the killpill and the hi-vis pill. Rigged up sheave weels and cabels, before picking up TRFC-H assy. no 1. Connected single controlline and cont. to run in hole with tubing. Picked up TRFC-H assy. no 2, connected the dual controlline and continue to run in hole on tubing and 1/2 tubing. Picked up TRFC-H no. 3, connected single controlline and continue run in hole with tubing. The dual controlline continue together with the single up to the production packer. Picked up the 5/8 production packer, pulled the tripple controlline through, and spleiced to the controllines comming from below. Continue to run in hole with tubing. Picked up the DHSV and connected controlline to same and continue to run in with tubing. Picked up tubing hanger, cycled lover and middle TRFC-H to closed position. Picked up landingstring w/ running tool and prep. control lines. Rigged WL-BOP. Displaced tubing to LTO. Cycled upper TRFC-H to closed position. Pressure tested tbg. Inflow tested DHSV. Set packers and pressure tested annulus. Installed BPV w/ dart. Pressure tested BPV. Rig down WL-BOP, closed DHSV and pulled landing string.4.2 Daily operations The daily operation reports covering the completion phase are given in section B.3 of the Final Well Report. 4.3 Time distribution The time distribution for the completion phase is given in sect.
