Appendix 35-1-1 Wraplt.doc Page of 21The 35/1-1 well (a wildcat HPHT deepwater exploration well spudded on 28 May 2002), is located offshore Norway in the North Sea in Block 35/1. This block is approximately 60 km north-east of the Snorre Field in 408 of water. This well was designed to drill to total depth of 4570 meters MD/TVD RKB to evaluate the Jurassic and Triassic sands. The primary objective was the Statfjord formation and the secondary objectives were the Jurassic Cook and Triassic Lunde formations. All objectives were found wet. The actual TD of the well was 4540 MD. The temperature at TD was 152C and the bottomhole pressure was 11549 psi. The maximum mud weight was sg. The time from spudding of the well to reaching TD was days. The rig was released on 19 July 2002, days after it went on contract. There were no accidents, spills or critical incidents that occurred on this well. The AFE to drill, log and abandon the well was 90 days and 246,681,760 NOK or $26,468,000 USD. The actual days to drill, log and abandon the well was days at cost of 132,408,663 NOK or $17,218,291. The well operations were completed 39% under time and 46% under NOK AFE cost and 35% under USD cost. Despite the additional requirements for HPHT operations and drilling without riser margin, the well reached total depth faster than the composite Best Sections of offset wells and established new drilling benchmark for the area. The contributing factors to setting this benchmark were more efficient On bottom drilling time and effective flat spot management. Each hole section was drilled in one bit run with the highest ROP's in the area.Well Name: 35/1-1 Permit: PL 269 Wellbore Number File Code: 6-50-35/1-1 Designation: Exploration Operator: Phillips Petroleum Company Norway Drilling Contractor: Odfjell Drilling AS Drilling Rig: DeepSea Bergen Rig Type: Semi-submersible Rig Heading: 224.6 Water Depth: 408 Rotary Table: 23 AMSL Total Depth: 4540 MD / TVD Maximum Temperature: 153 Maximum BHP Pressure: 11549 psi / 796 bar Final Surface Location: Lat. 61 50' Long. 03 04' Easting 503,863.4 Location Reference Datum: ED50 Rig on Location: 04:30 hours, 27 May 2002 Rig on Contract: 19:55 hours, 24 May 2002 Spud Date: 20:30 hours, 28 May 2002 TD Date: 02:00 hours, 07 July 2002 Spud to TD: 38 days, 12 hours Rig Release Date: 02:36 hours, 19 July 2002 Total Well Duration: 55 days, hours (on contract  off contract) Status: Permanently Plugged and AbandonedSTURLASON 35/1-1 DRILLING PERFORMANCE A 6000 E woo EP Sturlason AFE Sturlason Actual ' - Best Hole Sections 34/02-02 Amoco 1980 34/02-03 Amoco 1981 Hydro 2001 35/04-01 ActUa AFE Hydro 1997 , 35/03-06 RWE 2002 DAYS NOTE The Best Hole Sections were normalized to the 35/01-01 hole section depths Actual mobilization times were normalized to SturlasonWell AFE Date Sturlason E801 30.10.2002 Estimated Recorded Actuals 30.10.02 Activity code Description Drilling Drilling Drilling B120 Long Lead Items Related to DST 932 000 744 070 482 041 0500 Oil Spill Preparedness 233 000 405 720 F400 Information.

The well should prove HC column height that would potentially spill into additional fault blocks. The well objectives for the 35/1-1 well were:  Drill well safely with minimal impact to the environment.  Obtain all geologic and reservoir data listed in the data objective section.  Maximize penetration rates to minimize time on location.  Optimize planning and execution during flat spots to minimize time on location. The data objectives for the 35/1-1 well were:  Obtain E-logs to determine porosity, water saturation, permeability, velocity and formation pressures.  Sample reservoir to determine fluid PVT properties.  Cut whole core for porosity and permeability measurements. 2.2 Scorecard The well objectives listed above were all rated as full successes by the team. The well operations were completed under time and budget. Data acquisition goals were met. The quality of execution and technical performance are described in more detail in the scorecard.

Good hole conditions for logging were delivered. The wellbore allowed for the geologic and reservoir engineering information to be collected. However, due to strike by Service Company Union, the wireline program was shortened by runs. The original estimate of days to drill and abandon the 35/1-1 was 90 days at the original AFE cost of $26,468,000 with TD of 4540 MD. The actual time to drill and abandon the well was 55,3 days with an the actual cost of $17,500,000. A table is shown below detailing AFE versus actual times for each step.

Additional work was then undertaken with respect to HPHT training, crew competency and compensating measures required when drilling without riser margin. Hazids were conducted regarding risks of drilling without riser margin and compensating measures were implemented. regulatory gap analysis should be performed on all exploration drilling programs in future to ensure that the requirements in Government Regulations and NORSOK standards are fully understood and addressed. 35-1-1 Wrapit.doc Page 13 of 214. Analysis and Discussion 4.1. Project Planning, Teamwork and Resource Utilization Project planning was excellent for the drilling and abandonment portion of the well. However, the planning for drill stem test should have started earlier with the designated test engineer identified as soon as the decision was made to test. The teamwork was excellent between the different PPCoN groups and contractors. Drilling supervisor resources should have been identified much sooner. The drilling supervisors were not assigned until few days before their hitch was about to start. This did not allow them enough time to review, change or improve the planned operations they were about to perform. A Drill-the-Well-On-Paper excersise was held with all the service company representatives that resulted in several positive improvement suggestions. During the planning stages Baker Hughes Oasis Engineering Services performed drilling hazards study that was very beneficial and resulted in single bit run per hole section. Recommendations: If there is any possibility of testing, it needs to be planned before the well spuds. Justification: See description above. Recommendations: Identify the Drilling Supervisors months before spud date. 4.2. EHS The HES performance for the Deepsea Bergen on the Sturlason well was very good. Hazard Identification Meetings (HAZID) were held on the following topics: general well program, operations, riser margin, HPHT competency and drill stem testing. Information from these meetings were used to create risk register. There were no accidents, spills or critical incidents that occurred during this operation. Daily reports revealed pro-active approach towards any potential incidents / unsafe conditions and very high reporting culture. The following non-critical incidents were registered on the Deepsea Bergen during this period: First Aid DSB - One person used hydraulic jacking pump, when the oil filling chamber plug hit him on the nose and hydraulic oil splashed into his face. The medic was contacted and gave advice on cleaning off the hydraulic oil. The person went back to work. Near Miss DSB - An BX elevator insert (43 kg) was lifted out of basket and fell down to the catwalk through an open hatch on the rig floor. Nobody was injured. The drop area below was roped off, due to the ongoing logging operation. Safety Bulletin have been prepared. Near Miss DSB - When racking back one std DP wire to stand lift on lower manipulator arm broke, and caused pipe to drop 0.5m down to set back area. Pipe could not move as it was held in fingerboard and lower manipulator arm was still in closed position around pipe. No personnel in area, and the potential was low since the pipe could only drop to the set back area. 4.3. Logistics and Communication There were no problems with logistics. In fact, the logistics were handled very efficiently, especially considering that this was an exploration well that used different equipment than the standard used on Ekofisk and was operated out of base great distance from the Stavanger area. There were many problems with communications involving e-mail and DIMS from the rig. Page 14 of 21Recommendations: Identify the accountable persons within the Phillips and Contractor Information Technology Department at the beginning of the project. Inter-Contractor IT departments should also be identified when programs like Insite are used to minimize the problems interfacing with Anadrills LWD information. Justification: Having dedicated and accountable person responsible for the communications plan will minimize problems. 4.4. Geological Forecast The plot below is summary of the predicted and actual formation tops. The pre-spud temperature estimate found in Section was found to be very accurate versus the actual temperatures. The pre- spud pore pressure estimates can be found in Section 1.4. The Phillips PP estimate derived empirically from offset data was the most accurate. The pore pressure estimates from Seismic and Sperry Suns PP/FG Program underestimated actual pore pressures in the Cook Formation sands which were hydraulically charged from deeper parts of the structure.

TR YOGVA.SON BLODONS FM MIME GM r 77-1111 ii Page 15 of 21Revision 31-Oct-02 Recommendations: Be aware of the limitations of pore pressure assessment models and ensure that real time assessment is based on more than one technique. Justification: The Pore Pressure engineering service provided by Sperry Sun relied totally on their proprietary effective stress model and did not consider other indicators such as wellbore stability, connection gas, and lithology changes. The effective stress model often calculated increases in pressure which were not supported by other indicators. Higher pressure encountered in the Cook Formation sands indicate that they are not in equilibrium with the shales above. This could not be assessed in real time as all pore pressure models are based on shale lithology model. 4.5. Mobilization The DSB was towed from Block 1/5 where it was drilling an exploration well for Amerada Hess. The last anchored was bolstered at 19:55 on 24 May 2002. The anchor handling vessels used were the Tom Heron, Pacific Banner and the Northern Corona. The rig was then towed 310 nm to Block 35/1 using the Pacific Banner. The rig arrived on location at 04:30 hrs with the help of good weather and light tail wind. The total sailing time was hours and the average speed was knots. The rig was towed with 99 stands of 5-1/2, ppf, S-135 drill pipe in the derrick. The rig was moored using an 8-point spread. The anchors used were the Stevpris type. No piggyback anchors were used. While handling the anchors the 15 joints of 5-1/2 HWDP, joints of DC and joints of 9-1/2 DC were picked up and racked back in the derrick. The rig was ballasted down from transit draft to drilling draft. Note: The rig positioning was off 21 to the North. This was due to the operators inputting the wrong antenna offset in the positioning software. Additionally, the procedural safe guards that were in place to prevent this problem were not followed and the problem was not discovered until the well had already been spud. See Fugro report No. 7301 for more details. Before spudding the 30 conductor, the PGB with the TITUS system was run and hung off on the BOP trolley. The 36 BHA consisting of 17-1/2 bit along with 17-1/2 26 hole opener and 26 36 hole opener was made up and the well spud at 20:30 on 28 May 2002. The total mobilization time was days. There was no non-productive time. Recommendations: Continue to move rig with drill pipe in the derrick when drilling non-HPHT wells. Justification: Moving with drill pipe in the derrick will save time while drilling. However, it does not allow for drillpipe inspection. Detailed logistical plans must be made to prevent downtime onloading equipment due to the reduced VDL. Recommendations: Consider having third party QA/QC positioning company. Justification: In this instance, the rig positioning error was 21 m. It could just as easily have been 2100 m. This service is so crucial it is worth the added expense to ensure that it is done correctly. 4.6. Drilling Operations The 36 hole section was drilled with Hughes Christensen MX-TO3DX TCI bit, 17-1/2 26 Smith hole opener and 26 36 Smith hole opener along with an Anderdrift tool for inclination. The section was drilled from 431 to 503 MD/TVD in hours for an average ROP of m/hr. The mud system used was seawater with bentonite sweeps. The parameters for this short run were 0-2 MT WOB with 70 to 90 RPM's resulting in 0-5 Klbs torque. The flow rate ranged from 3700-4800 Ipm with 115 to 135 bar 35-1-1 Wraplt.doc Page 16 of 21SPP. The well was displaced to 1,35 sg WBM at section TD. wiper trip was made to the mud line and back to TD. No fill or drag was noted. The bit dull grade was 1-1-WT-A-E-I-NO-TD on the rig. The inner string was run inside the 30 casing. The casing and PGB was run and cemented at 429 MD using m3 of sg class cement and 20 m3 of sg class cement. The stickup was above seabed and the wellhead inclination was 0.75. The conductor was held in tension for hours. The 30 was then topped up using the TITUS system with 16 m3 of sg class cement. The conductor was held for an additional hours before releasing the running tool. The 26 packed BHA was made up and RIH. Cement was tagged at 496 and the shoetrack was drilled out. No LOT was taken. The total 36 section time was days with 3.5% NPT. Recommendations: When drilling boulders use 17-1/2 bit and stage hole opener. Justification: The BHA drilled the boulders effectively with minimal angle building tendency. Recommendations: To facilitate topping up the 30 conductor use the DrilQuip TITUS system . Justification: This system was used to quickly and effectively top up the 30 conductor casing. Several of the wells in the Sturlason area had problems with structural support of the BOP and wellhead equipment due to high deviation and poor cement jobs on the 30 casing. Recommendations: Continue to use the Anderdrift tool for wellbore inclination in the top-hole sections. Justification: This tool provided hole inclination accurately in cost and time efficient manner as compared to both MWD and single shot surveys. The 26 hole section was drilled with Hughes Christensen GTXCMG1 mill tooth bit with an Anadrill MWD/LWD assembly consisting of the CDR LWD tool package containing survey, gamma ray, resistivity and PWD tool and Power Pulse MWD assembly. The section was drilled from 503 to 878 MD in 28 hours for an average ROP of m/hr. Seawater was used along with bentonite sweeps. One half stand precautionary backreaming was done prior to each connection. Tight spots were noted at 799 m, 747 m, 749 m, 688-683 m, 663-660 m, 590 and 586 MD. The drilling parameters for this run ranged from 2-10 MT WOB with 50-100 RPM's resulting in 2-10 Klbs torque. The flow rate ranged from 3000 to 4430 Ipm with 83 to 180 bar SPP. The bit dull grade was 1-2-WT-A-E-I-NO-TD on the rig and 1-2-WT-S- X-1/16-LT/ER/CT-TD by HC onshore. The 20 casing and Dril-Quip SS-15 wellhead was run to 871 MD. The wellhead was locked into the 30 low pressure wellhead housing. The 20 was cemented with 85 m3 of sg lead cement followed by m3 of sg tail cement. The plug bumped and the float held. The plug would not hold the casing pressure test due to slow leak. The BOP stack was run and the shear ram and casing tested to 138 bar. The stack had been previously stump tested to 15K. The 17-1/2 20 ft pendulum BHA was made up and RIH. Safety meetings, choke drills and BOP function tests were performed. Cement was tagged at 842 and drilling commenced after the hole had been displaced to 1,25 sg Glydrill WBM. Cement was drilled to 878 and of new formation was drilled to 883 m. After circulating mud weight for hour, LOT was performed to 1,65 sg. The 26 hole section took days with 6% NPT. Page 17 of 21Recommendations: When using PWD do not circulate to even mud weight prior to LOT/FIT. Justification: This PWD tool will pulse up static mud weight which can be used along with the applied surface pressure for LOT/FIT purposes. On this well there was hours spent circulating prior to performing the LOT. By eliminating the time, 45,000 USD could be saved. The 17-1/2 hole section was drilled with Hughes Christensen MX-03DDT TCI bit with an Anadrill and PWD tools and Power Pulse MWD assembly. The section was drilled from 878 to 2245 MD in 63 hours resulting in an average ROP of 21,6 m/hr. The drilling parameters for this section were WOB of 15-25 MT with 90-160 RPM's creating torque of 8-15 Kft-lbs. The flow rate ranged from 3000-4330 Ipm with 140-260 bar SPP. The mud system used was 1.25-1.34 sg Glydrill system with 175 kg/m3 of KCL and 5% Glycol. At 1600 MD the mud weight was increased on the fly to sg to the required mud weight at TD specified in the mud program. At 1821 MD the LWD failed. The casing point setting depth was then picked using cuttings. It should be noted that the potassium in the KCL/Glycol mud system masked the natural gamma ray readings of the formation and affected the CDR resistvity resulting in useless LWD log. At times during drilling, mud losses were encountered over the shakers, which resulted in an ROP limitation. A wiper trip was made to the mud line and back to TD. Tight spots were encountered and reamed. The bit dull graded was 1-1-WT-A-E-I-NO-TD on the rig and 4-1-BT-M-E-I-ER-TD by HC onshore. The bit damage on the middle rows were attributed to the extreme nozzles which eroded away the steel around the inserts. The inserts were then exposed more which allowed easier breakage. The well was logged using the Atlas Slam' tool string (GR/HDIL/XMAC/ZDL/CN). The one-arm caliper showed very out of gauge (up to inches) rugose hole. The wear bushing was recovered and the wellhead and BOP cavities jetted. 143 joints of 13-3/8 72 ppf P-110 NSCCSC casing were run using the La Fleur packer fillup tool. No drag was noted. The casing was cemented using 27 m3 of 1,56 sg lead cement and 25 m3 of 1,95 sg tail cement. The cement was displaced using the rig pumps with sg WBM. The plugs bumped and the floats held. The seal assembly was set. There was considerable flat spot due to various rig repairs and maintenance. The 10 IBOP was changed out with 15 IBOP. An RTTS was run and the LMRP was disconnected to repair the slip joint that was leaking. After retrieving the RTTS the open-ended drill pipe was run and the hole displaced to OBM. Due to several washouts the drill string was laid down and new drill string was picked up prior to entering the HPHT section. The BOP stack was tested. The well was displaced to 1,5 sg Versaport OBM. The 12-1/4 motor BHA was made up and RIH while picking up drill pipe. The shoe track was drilled and 3 of new formation. flowback foot print was taken. timeout was held on HPHT procedures. After circulating to even mud weight LOT was performed to 1,75 sg. The 17-1/2 hole section took days with 31.5% NPT. Recommendations: Run Glydrill system with 175 kg/m3 of KCL with 5% Glycol. Consider improving the solids control equipment to minimize shaker blinding and resultant reduced ROP. Justification: The average ROP of 21,6 m/hr is one of the best ROP's for the 17-1/2 section in recent times. The fastest 17-1/2 section in the Sturlason area was the 34/4-10 at 25,5 m/hr. There was considerable time spent backreaming out of the hole on this well. There were no problems with gumbo Page 18 of 21as seen on the 2/4X-15 WBM section (14,1 m/hr ROP) and the Herje-1 WBM section (11,7 m/hr ROP). It also compares favorably with the best 16 OBM section on 2/4X-18 with an average ROP of 25,3 m/hr. The cuttings on Sturlason were at all times dry and brittle indicating good inhibition. Recommendations: When KCL/Glycol mud systems are used do not use the CDR resistivity tools. Instead use the vision resistivity tool. Justification: The potassium in the KCL mud system affects the gamma ray reading from the formation and the resistivity as measured from the CDR. The vision tools can be compensated for the potassium errors. Recommendations: On the drilling parameters log, the mud loggers should track average WOB, RPM and flow rate for each connection and connection time in the comments section. Justification: Having this information will highlight hidden time and speed operations. The 12-1/4 hole section was drilled with 12-1/4 HC606 PDC bit, 9-5/8 GT Anadrill Power Pack mud motor (1.15 bend with 12-1/8 sleeve stabilizer and 7:8 lobe configuration), an Anadrill MWD/LWD assembly consisting of the CDR LWD tool package containing survey, gamma ray, resistivity and PWD tools and Power Pulse MWD. The section was drilled from 2245 to 3834 MD in 127 hours for an average ROP of 12,5 m/hr. The mud system used was 1.5-1.61 sg Versaport mineral OBM system without riser margin. Mud density increases were made at 3452 MD to sg, at 3763 MD to 1,58 sg and at TD where the mud weight was raised to 1,61 sg to replace the ECD for trip margin. The cuttings were transferred to skips using Clyde Cuttings Blower and then shipped to Soilcare at Mongstad for disposal. HTHP Procedures were implemented from 3454 MD and the section was drilled to TD without incidents. All the flow checks were negative and the background gas levels were low. The string was pumped out of the hole to the 13-3/8 casing shoe. No tight spots or overpulls were observed. flow check was performed before pumping slug. The BHA was pulled out of the hole and laid down. The bit dull grade was 6-5-LT-N-X-1-BT-TD on the rig and 1-2-WT-S-X-1/16-LT/ER/CT-TD by HC onshore. The well was logged using the Atlas 'Z' Slam tool string (GR/HDIL/XMAC/ZDL/CN). There were minor sticking tendencies that required one max overpull of Klbs. The wear bushing was recovered and the wellhead and BOP cavities jetted. Considerable amounts of long metal shavings were recovered off the WB. The jet sub was rerun and the BOP cavities were operated to remove possible debris. 51 joints of 9-7/8, 62,8 ppf TN110SS casing with AMS connections and 232 joints of 9-5/8, 53 ppf, TN110SS casing with AMS connections were run using the La Fleur packer fillup tool. radio active marker was added 84,3 from the shoe. No drag or losses were noted while running. After breaking circulation the well quickly went on complete losses most likely caused by the metal shavings and cuttings packing off at the casing hanger. The casing was cemented using 15 m3 of 1,92 sg lead cement and 10 m3 of 1,95 sg tail cement. The cement was displaced using the rig pumps with 1,61 sg OBM. The plugs bumped and the floats held. An attempt was made unsuccessfully to set the seal assembly. The wash assembly was run. When the assembly was pulled there were no indications on the plastic screws that the assembly had cleaned out to bottom. The assembly was rerun. This time there were indications that the tool had washed to bottom. The seal assembly was rerun and successfully set. The BOP stack was tested. The casing was pressure tested to 651 bar for 10 minutes. The 8-1/2 60' pendulum BHA was made up and RIH while picking up 5-1/2 drill pipe. Kick and strip drills were held and SCR's were taken. The shoe track, rathole and of new formation were drilled. Page 19 of 21There were numerous problems getting SCR's due to fluctuating SPP. After circulating to even mud weight, LOT was performed to sg EMW. The 12-1/4 hole section took days with 10.7% NPT. Recommendations: Establish procedures to safely weight up the mud system when drilling in HPHT mode in the overburden sections. Justification: The mud system is weighted up while drilling ahead in most wells. Procedures and compensating measures should be developed to allow this to be conducted safely in HPHT sections. This has the potential to make considerable increase in efficiency. The 8-1/2 hole section was drilled with Hughes Christensen HC607 PDC bit with an Anadrill MWD/LWD assembly consisting of the Vision Resistivity tool package containing survey, gamma ray, resistivity and PWD along with the RAB tool and Power Pulse MWD assembly. The section was controlled drilled in HPHT mode from 3834 to 4540 MD in days for an average ROP of 4,2 m/hr. The mud system used was 1,61-1,93 sg Versaport OBM. Mud density increases were made at 3933 MD to sg and at 4029 MD to 1,68 sg based on real time pore pressure estimates. At 4130 MD water kick was taken. The mud weight at 4130 MD was increased to 1,80 sg in one circulation. Premix was then added to the active system to lower the mud reheology and the mud weight was increased to 1,84 sg. Additional mud density increases were made at 4211 MD to 1,87 sg, at 4243 to 1,90 and at 4331 to 1,93 based on real time pore pressure estimates. The mud weight was dropped slowly to 1,90 sg at well TD of 4540 m. Very little connection gas was detected with most of mud density increases based on real time pore pressure estimation from the PP/FG program. The cuttings were transferred to skips using Clyde Cuttings Blower and then shipped to Soilcare at Mongstad for disposal. A wiper trip was made to 3820 MD and back to TD. Tight spots were encountered and reamed. The bit was pumped out of the hole and dull graded as 1-3-PN-H-X-1-LT-TD on the rig and 1-2-WT-S-X-1/16- LT/ER/CT-TD by HC onshore. The BOPE was tested while waiting on wireline crew. The wireline crew was delayed due to problems with NOPEF strike. This strike resulted in reduced e-line program to runs. Run #1 consisted of the Atlas 'Z' Slam tool string (GR/HDIUXMAC/ZDUCN). Run #2 consisted of MDT sample and pressure measurements. Run #3 consisted of rotary sidewall cores. Run #4, which was canceled, was planned to be nuclear magnetic imaging log (MIRL) along with an oil based mud formation imaging log (061). Run #5, which was canceled, was checkshot survey. The 8-1/2 hole section took days with 11.6% NPT. Recommendations: Maintain HPHT fluid loss guideline of < 4m1 at 300F. Justification: The reduced HPHT fluid loss guideline resulted in thinner filter cake, which improved logging conditions, compared to other HPHT exploration wells. 4.7. Testing A drill stem test was planned but not required. Page 20 of 21Revision 31-Oct-02 4.8. P&A and Demobilization A 24 joint 3-1/2 cement stinger was run to 4284 m. high vis pill was spotted from 4284-3876 MD. An m3 1,92 sg spacer was pumped followed by 7,68 m3 of 1,95 sg silica cement balanced plug. The stinger was pulled slowly to 3527 where the hole was circulated clean. While WOC excess drill pipe was laid down. The plug was tagged at 3548 and weight tested to 10 tons. To minimize disposal costs, 66 m3 of 2,2 sg kill mud and 36 m3 of slops were pumped above the cement. The stinger was POOH and laid down. A 9-5/8 EZSV was run on DP and set at 863 m. The casing was cut at 820 using Weatherford one trip cut and pull assembly. The grapple failed to catch and the assembly was POOH. spear assembly was run and the casing was pulled/jarred free with 145 MT over pull. 34 joints of 9-7/8 casing were laid down. cement stinger was RIH. m3 spacer was pumped followed by 13 m3 of 1,95 sg slurry. While WOC excess drill collars were laid down. The cement plug was tagged at m. The cement was weight tested to 10 MT and pressure tested to 155 bars for 10 minutes. The well was then displaced to seawater. The 13-3/8 casing was cut at 667 using one trip cut and pull system. The grapple failed to catch and the assembly was POOH. spear assembly was run and the casing was pulled/jarred free. 18 joints of 13-3/8 casing were laid down. 13-3/8 EZSV was set on DP at 662 and pressure tested to 70 bar. An m3 spacer was pumped followed by m3 of sg slurry. The BOP stack and riser were pulled. The 20/30 casing was cut at 436 (5 BML) using the Weatherford MOST tool in one trip with 190 MT overpull. After pulling anchors the rig was towed to CCB Agotnes. The rig was off contract at 02:36 19 July 2002. The total plugging, abandonment and demobilization time was days with 5.4% NPT. Recommendations: Do not use the Weatherford one trip cut and pull system. Justification: Mechanically engaging the grapple with this system is difficult due to its poor design. Baker Oil Tools has hydraulic design that appears to be better system. 5. List of References w/File Location 0:1Teams1MaxWell1PublicISturlasonlExploration135_1-11Job01@2001 6.

Reviewed activities during Maxwell Well Panning Phase ( GOFORIT thru PLANIT/AFE) - What lessons were learned?  ,r Resources should have been assigned to project immediately after Block Award in order to achieve an early 2002 spud.  Well Planning Phase took longer than anticipated due to the necessity to reprocess seismic data. Detailed well planning was delayed until this data was available. Seismic reprocessing should in future be completed prior to commencement of Planning Phase. Geoscience resources should have been assigned to project earlier to accelerate this work.  Site Survey: Well location was not finalized until Dec.2001 which required site survey be performed in mid winter. Luckily, no serious delays were encountered and the survey indicated the location was acceptable. Geoscience resources should have been assigned to project earlier as above. Consider shooting large area wide grid survey in future to provide more flexibility in both timing and well relocation. Also need to consider how to determine additional detail if seabed anomalies cannot be avoided.  Pore pressure prediction was not completed prior to contractingof Rig or preparation of AFE. This should:be completed prior to either activity in future. Geoscience resources should be assigned to project earlier as above.  DST requirements, recommendations and planning should be discussed with partners earlier in future as integral part of data acquisition strategy.  New regulatory requirements have not presented any significant problems for this project.  Rig Compliance Auditing was simplified by utilizing SUT information and working jointly with other operators ( RVVE-DEA and A. HESS) planning to use the same rig.  Drilling Team Leader should have been assigned earlier in the project to handle opertional issues and allow Drilling Engineer to focus on well design  Contracts for services should have been finalized earlier so that data could be obtained for discharge permit  Environmental philosophy ( meet regulations or best in class) should be clarified in advance  Roles and responsibilities during Well Planning Phase should be better defined in future  Data on offset wells is often difficult and time consuming to obtain. Data on H2S and CO2 content is difficult to obtain. Start acquisition process earlier in future.  Data for blowout modelling was delayed due to shortgae of resources - 17th round activities Actions: What? Who? When?  Attach Document to Maxwell Plan  Greg Beebe  10.04.02    Share lessons learned?

Document requirements for data communications between Rig and Tananager 19. State in ERA & Consent if use of dispersants is an option 20. Need more effective ways of communicating goals (HES, competency, operational requirements) to all 21. Utilise one consultancy for HAZID assistance to ensure continuity 22. Need to improve utilisation of RISK-IT 23. Document requirements for Key Supplier inter-communication 24. Training and competency must be properly documented as to: company requirements, mapping competency of rig crew and service personnel, documenting CV reviews, ensuring that requirements and training documentation are available offshore. 25. Assign Drilling Supervisors well in advance of spud 26. Rig rep (material man) should visit Supply Base location and Base representative should visit rig to ensure good communication and system understanding 27.
