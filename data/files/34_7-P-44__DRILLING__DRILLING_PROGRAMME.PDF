((( kialWell 34/7-P-44 will be an oil producer. The well will be drilled from Snorre TLP, and is the 25th well drilled to TD and completed from the Snorre TLP. The main objective for Well 34/7-P-44 is:  Oil production from the Northern parts of the Western Fault Block (WFB), Upper Statfjord Fm. The secondary objectives for Well 34/7-P-44 are:  Oil production from WFB, Lower Statfjord and Upper Lunde Fm (L02)  Data acquisition in order to improve understanding of the sedimentology in the area and for update of the geological, petrophysical and geophysical models. Maximum pore pressure is prognosed to be sg at the top of the Cromer Knoll BCU / Statfjord (S5) at approximately 2479 ND RKB. The pore pressure will decrease to approximately sg entering the Lunde Fm, and then increase to approximately sg when re-entering S5. In the Statfjord Fm, pressure will decrease to approximately sg in S4 and S3 and sg in Si based on the most likely pressure (Fig 5.9). The well is classified with level H2S preparedness. The 30 Conductor is already run at 527 mMD and cemented during pre-drilling phase in April 1991. The 24 section was drilled to 1150 MD (1105 ND) on the 16th of June 1996. The 18 5/8 casing was run and set at MD (1099 ND) with an inclination of 34. The 18-5/8 surface casing is not pressure tested. The 16 section will be drilled to 3005 MD, which is into the Shetland Fm. The 13 3/8 casing will be set at 3000 MD with an inclination of 56 and an azimuth of 4. The 12 1/4 section will penetrate Lunde Fm and be drilled to Statfjord S4 estimated at 5835 m MD. The 5/8 liner will be set at 5830 mMD with an inclination of 89 inclination and an azimuth of 310. The 1/2 section will be drilled to TD approximately at 6630 MD and penetrates the Statfjord reservoir zones and approximately 50 into the Dunlin Fm. The 5-1/2 liner will be run and cemented with an inclination of 89 at TD. The well will be completed with 5-1/2 tubing and Cameron McEvoy X-mas tree will be installed.

Secondary objective is oil production from Lower Statgord and Lunde Fm. (L02) in WFB north, and data acquisition in order to improve understanding of the area and for update of the geological, petrophysical and geophysical models. 5.2 Well Location The main factors when placing P-44 have been optimum drainage of Statford in WFB North and in addition to include possible new Linde reserves in WFB Main. The target locations are defined as follows: UTME UTMN TVD RIO TD Criteria The well is expected to TD in the Mullin Formation after Top Reservoir has been penetrated. The TD criterion is confirmed Top Reservoir plus sufficient rathole for running of TLC logs through the complete reservoir section, and allowing for completion in the complete reservoir section (usually rathole of about 55m MD). TD is prognosed at 6630 MD RKB / 2593 TVD R1CB, but is dependant on the factors mentioned above. Target Tolerances Target tolerance limits (driller's target) are illustrated in Figure 5.12. The most important factor is the distance to the Outer Snorre Fault (OSF). Target tolerance is low on the east side of the well track. Gyro will be run if in-field reference does not give sufficiently accurate positioning information (note : This will be clarified before start drilling this well). If Lunde is oil-filled, the wellpath has to be adjusted according to reservoir zonation while drilling to ensure penetration of all LO2 sands before the well is landed horizontally. The well path is optimised for production from Lunde Fm, L02. 5.3 Reservoir Development The primary objective of P-44 is oil production from Upper Statford (S and S2) in the northern part of Western Fault Block (WFB). Secondary objectives are Lower Statford and Upper Linde (L02) oil production. The Lower Statford reserves are secondary objective because the estimated Lower Statford reserves are low (0.2 MSm3). Increased recovery from Lower Statford in WFB is major challenge and will be in focus the coming year. Estimated reserves for Upper Statgord is MSm3. The production rate from Upper Statford (assumed produced alone) is expected to drop quite early due to lack of pressure support. Communication over the faulted area between WFB Main and WFB 1 Snorre TLPNorth will affect the production rate decrease. If communication over the faulted area is good, P-44 will probably get some pressure support from injectors in WFB Main. In that case timing of planned injector 901 will not be as important as if the communication is low. The expected need for injection support for P-44 is estimated to be in the time window - 12 months. It will be important to collect production data from Statfiord alone (close the sleeves over Lunde) to gain sufficient information to optimise planning of injection well 901. The Upper Lunde part of the well will be an appraisal well (the Lunde volumes in WFB has not yet been proved). It is expected that an aquifer will give some pressure support to the LO2 production. The need of injection support will be evaluated after drilling and achievement of some production experience from P44. The planned DIACS solution over the Lunde part of the well will give flexibility to shut in and build up pressure in the Lunde part while the Statfiord part still produces. The production rate from L02 is not estimated due to lack of available information. Zonal isolation in the reservoir section is very important for reservoir management (water and gas shutoff) 5.4 Geological and Structural Setting Seismic Interpretation Structural maps at BCU, top Statfiord and top LO3 are given in Figures 5.4, and.5.6. A seismic line along the well track is given in Figure 5.1. BCU and top Statfiord are both very good reflectors in this area. strong black reflector has been interpreted as top L03 shale. Shales in LO4 generate two extensive black events. The seismic data between the BCU and approximately 2500 ms is of generally higher amplitude than the data below 2500 ms. study performed by PUS ('Evaluation of the Snorre Amplitude Anomaly', PUS, October 1999, ref. 993660/H) indicates that this anomaly is caused by an oil-water contact (OWC) in Lunde, depth converted to approximately 2590 MSL. The extent of the anomaly has been mapped and extends almost as far south as P-33. This is illustrated in Figure 5.3, which is an attribute map generated from the seismic data in L02. The strong amplitude response is shown in red with the well path through L02 highlighted. There are several faults in the area, which is near the junction of the northern end of the Murchison Fault and an E-W fault system (see Figure 5.6). The well has been designed to lie as far updip as possible in L02, and in an unfaulted area in the Statfiord Fm. Upper Statfiord should be penetrated west of Fault 1. The faults (illustrated in Figure 5.6) are of relatively small throw though the system but may generate some sealing potential in the Stattord Fm towards the south. Figure is seismic line through the Outer Snorre Fault (OSF) between the WFB and the CFB. Lower Statfiord sands in the CFB are potentially thrown against LO2 sands in the WFB. There will therefore be possibility of some pressure reduction in L02 caused by Lower Stat6ord production from CFB in P-38. Geology The stratigraphic prognosis is listed in Table below and illustrated by geological cross section along the well path in Figure 5.7. The figure is derived from the official geological model from 1997 whilst the prognosis has been modified slightly to utilise information from the new seismic dataset (SG 9701). The sequence above the BCU is expected to be quite homogenous throughout the WFB. Rather than describing it here, reference is made to Final Well Reports for wells 34/7-4, P-39, P-32 and P42 A.For the Lunde reservoir section, reference is made to wells 34/4-9 S, 34/74 and P-33. For the Statgord reservoir section, reference is made to the exploration well 34/7-4, located approximately 5-600 south south-west of the planned P44 position at top Stalfiord level. 34/74 is regarded as quite representative concerning the development of the Stafford Fm in this area. P44 is expected to first penetrate zones LO1 and L02, before entering the top LO3 zone. Thereafter the zones will be penetrated in reversed stratigraphical order . small fault into WFB-North will be penetrated close to top LO1 before Statford Fm (S5-S1) is penetrated in WFB North. M is planned in the Dunlin Op (see Figures and 5.7). There is possibility that the well at top reservoir level will enter the lower parts of the 55 zone before penetrating L01. This is the picture from the official geological model, while the new seismic interpretation (SG 9701) gives completely eroded S5 zone below BCU. The LO3 horizon from the new interpretation is also somewhat deeper than in the official geomodel. Hence, it is uncertain if P-44 will penetrate S5 at top reservoir level, and also if LO3 will be penetrated at the deepest stratigraphical point in the well. Uncertainties in MD given in Table above for zone LO3 reflect the possibility of not penetrating L03. The TVD uncertainties for the prognosed formation tops will be reduced when BCU is penetrated, but the measured depth of each zone will still be very uncertain due to the high inclination in the well. The sand development and reservoir properties in zone LO2 in the WFB wells seem to be slightly poorer than in the CFB and EFB wells. However, seismic interpretation indicates well-developed channelbelt sandstones in the lower part of L02. Lateral continuity is expected to be good. WFB-North is an area with considerable geological uncertainty and no production wells. Reservoir zones LO1 and S5 are expected to contain mainly mudstones and crevasse sand / sheet flood sand, but there are also possibilities these zones can contain minor channel sands. Reservoir zones S4 and 53 are expected to contain fining-upward units with fluvial channel sands of variable stacking frequencies interbedded with paleosols with variable degree of maturity and crevasse sands. Only minor channel sands are expected, due to the low net / gross observed in Lower Statford in 34/74. Sand probability maps created from the seismic inversion also confirm the low net / gross. Lateral continuity is expected to be restricted. The upper part of Statford (Si and S2) is expected to be fairly well developed and contain continuous sandstone bodies with good lateral and vertical continuity. Base Si has eroded relatively deep into the underlying S2 zone in 34/74. The amount of SI erosion in the P44 area is uncertain. Table shows expected reservoir parameters for P44. The parameters are mainly based on averaged values from wells P42 A, P-39, P-32, P-33, 34/4-9 and 34/74. There is high degree of uncertainty related to the amount of sand in each zone, especially in the Lunde and Lower Statgord reservoir zones. This will also influence the uncertainties related to the other reservoir parameters. Zone dip will also vary somewhat when drilling through or close to faults or faulted areas. OWC The initial oil water contact in Statford is interpreted at 2680 TVD MSL. The most likely contact in Lunde is expected at 2561 MSL based on Lunde contact observed in EFB and ECFB. Investigation of seismic anomaly seen in the Lunde formation indicates possible deeper contact about 2590 MSL. P44 is not expected to penetrate the OWC, but VSP data will hopefully give information about Lunde OWC.5.5 Pore Pressure The pore pressure prognosis is presented in Figures and 5.9. Figure illustrates maximum, minimum and most likely pressure curves for the different reservoir zones. Pore Pressure above reservoir level From seabed down to approximately 1450 TVD, hydrostatic pressure gradient is expected. The pore pressure build up from 1450 TVD RKB to top reservoir level is verified by RFT measurements in Lista / Sele Fm. in wells 34/7-17 and -18 south of the Snorre Field. shaded area illustrates uncertainty in pressure estimates throughout the Rogaland Op and the Shetland Fm as illustrated in Figure 5.8.  Reservoir Pore Pressure The pressure development in the WFB depends on several elements:  Production, injection and aquifer response  Sand volumes  Sand connectivity  Deposition / erosion  Faulting and fault seal  Crossflow in wells Lack of frequent PLT logs and poor allocation control between sands in the wells result in uncertain distribution of production and injection into different zones. The most important wells related to pressure in the P44 location are producer P-39 and the injector P-32. They are in the WFB-Main segment while P-44 will be drilled in WFB-North, introducing the uncertainty of fault sealing. Background for the pressure prognosis is given for each zone. Note that the pressures given are at datum of 2475 TVD MSL and must be corrected to the relevant depth of penetration using an oil gradient of bar/m. One of the most important factors for the pressure prognoses and the production behaviour of well P-44 are the degree of sealing in the faulted area between the southern parts of WFB-North and WFB-Main. The throw decrease from west to east, but the faulted area is still expected to give some restrictions and irregular communication. The FAWAG project of WFB will be ongoing in the northern part of WFB-Main (in well P-32) in the period prior to drilling P44 into the Statfiord Fm. It will be very important to keep the voidage of WFB-Main to maintain the reservoir pressure in WFB above 300 bar. Initial pore pressure at top reservoir level (2420 TVD MSL) is 379 bar, corresponding to an equivalent mud weight (EMW) of g/cc. At TD the initial pressure gradient has dropped to g/cc EMW (2534 TVD MSL). Cromer Knoll The Cromer Knoll Formation consists of marl and does not include any sands. Zone S5 It is uncertain if S5 will be present below Cromer Knoll in P44. If present, crevasse sands, probably sands with different pressures can be expected in 55. The sand continuity of S5 is low and it isexpected that some of the sands will have initial pressure. To what extent the SS sands communicate and is depleted are uncertain, but low estimate is set at 320 bar. High = 383 bar = Pressure equal to initial ML = 383 bar = Pressure equal to initial Low = 320 bar = Engineering judgement - based on Lower Statf ord (S3 and S4) pressure of 300 bar (P-39 PLT ran in June 1998). Estimated some higher pressure due to restrictions because of faults between well P-44 and P-39. Zones LOL LO2 and LO3 Well P-44 penetrates L01, LO2 and possibly parts of LO3 before zones LO2 and L01 is penetrated in reverse stratigraphic order. High pressure sands, particularly in LO1 and LO2 should be expected. As mentioned above, the Lunde part of P44 represents an appraisal well. There has not been any direct production from Lunde in WFB and the production from West Central Fault Block (WCFB), expected to be in communication with WFB Lunde volumes, has not started. High estimate is therefore set to initial pressure. ML = 360 bar = Engineering judgement - expect some depletion from initial pressure due to possible communication between Lunde and depleted zones. Low = 320 bar = Engineering judgement - based on the similar idea as for the most likely case, however assuming relatively good connnunication between Lunde and depleted zones CFB. The estimated low pressure is somewhat higher than the average pressure of WFB-Main (see Figure 5.8) based on expected 'tan_ietions of the faulted zone between P44 and WEB- Main. Expect crevasse sands and shales in S5, and probably sands with different pressures. The continuity of sandbodies within SS is low and it is expected that some of the sands can have initial pressure. To what extent the SS sands communicate and is depleted are uncertain, but low estimate is set at 320 bar. Low = 320 bar = Engineering judgement- based on Lower Stafford (S4 and S3) pressure at 300 bar in P-39 PLT ran in June 1998. Estimated some higher pressure due to restrictions because of faults between well P44 and well P-39. Zones S4 and S3 Pore pressure prognosis of Lower Stafford has high degree of uncertainty. Well 34/74 drilled in WEB-North quite close to P44 position has poor development of Lower Stafford with respect to net / gross ratio (drilled prior to production start of Snorre). The net / gross ratios of Lower Statford of P- 44 are therefore highly uncertain. ML = 340 bar = Engineering judgement - high degree of uncertainty. Lower Statford has less continous sands than Upper Statford and lower degree of communication is expected. Low = 300 bar =- Engineering judgement - Assumed high degree of communication to depleted sands, based on Lower Statord (S4 and S3) pressure at 300 bar in P-39 PLT ran in June 1998. 34/7-P-44 Revision: Date: 21.01.00The low estimate is not equal to lowest Lower Statord pressure measured in WFB in well P-21 at 270 bar in the summer of 1998. Do not expect as low pressure as in P-21 because the faulted zone between P-44 and WFB-Main is likely to restrict the communication. Zones S2 and Si A review of the 34/7-4 well test interpretation has been done. The review concludes with no major changes of the conclusion; the test is not able to detect any restrictions. However the test is affected by tidal effects in distance of approximately 350 meters from the well (approximately at the same distance as the expected fault restrictions). High = 360 bar = Engineering judgement  expect at least some degree of communication between the sheet sands in Upper Statord and depleted reservoirs  estimated 20 bar from initial pressure. ML = 320 bar = Engineering judgement  expect somewhat higher pressure in Upper Statord in WFB-North compared to WFB-Main due to restrictions introduced by the faulted zone between P-44 and P-39. Low = 290 bar = Engineering judgement - based on general low level of Upper Statord pressure in WFB-Main. Assumes high degree of communication between WFB-North and WFB-Main. Important to note that this pressure could be highly affected by the possible low voidage (and pressure) due to the FAWAG project. Dunlin / TD The Mullin Op is in general shale and the well is not expected to penetrate any sands in Dunlin. 5.6 Wellbore Stability General Figure shows fracture and collapse curves (m MD RICB) in the reservoir based on most likely reservoir pressure. Figure 12 shows fracture and collapse curves throughout the well (m TVD RICB). The collapse curve (coil) identifies the mud weight necessary to avoid ovalization and fill; if loss situation is expected it is acceptable to run mud weight lower than the collapse curve. However, if mud weight is reduced below this criterion breakdown (collapse) could be caused. Two fracture curves are displayed, Sh(dP) and Fr(nonPen) - the first one represents the fracture gradient if the fluid communication between the wellbore and the formation is 100 %. It is identical to instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP) - the second fracture curve represents no communication between the well and the formation (100% effective mud cake); it is dependent on the well inclination and the angle between well azimuth and the direction of major horizontal stress. The two fracture gradients represent the two extremes. Both horizontal stresses and fracture gradients are dependent of the amount of depletion. A proper way to drill the reservoir will be to use comparatively low mud weight giving an ECD which is lower than or equal to the smallest fracture gradient Sh(dP) in the low pressure scenario, and then - if necessary - increase the mud weight moderately when the fracture strength has increased due to mud cake growth. 1 Snorre TLP Well Program Page of 21 FORMATION DATABased on the most likely pore pressure gradient, 52 will have the lowest pressure and fracture gradient. This results in minimum fracture gradient, Sh(dP) based on most likely reservoir pressure of SG. If the minimum pressure is applicable, the minimum fracture gradient in LO2 will be SG. LOT from the well 34/7-P-42 in the same fault block suggests that the correction factor for depletion might have been considerably more optimistic than applied for this well (see the data section. below). It would give more optimistic values for the minimum fracture gradient with SG in case of most likely pressure, and SG for minimum pressure. This is however only based on one data point. The collapse gradient is estimated to be around SG in the reservoir; high degree of caution is recommended while drilling the S3 shale, since stuck pipe incident happened in the same formation in 34/7-P-42 in the same fault block. Recommendation The ECD when drilling 1/2 hole is expected to be in the interval 1.63-1.64 SG (calculated with RPM = 60 - 120, assumed MW = SG and pump rate of 1200 LPM). With mud weight of SG the ECD will be 1.61-1.62 SG, which is sufficient to keep below the lowest fracture gradient (mentioned above). high degree of caution is recommended while drilling the 53 shale (see previous section), since this is very weak. Data Referring to study on field stresses on the Tampen area (Jorgensen, Bratli: Spenningsvurdering for feltene nmdt Tampen utstikkeren, basert pa inversion av splittetrylck, 1995) the overburden is calculated to be SG at the top of the reservoir. representative density log from the area has been integrated to give the overburden (Sv), which has been adjusted to the value at top reservoir mentioned previously. The local stress field has been used: AzH SH/Sv Sh/Sv Data set at 5/8 shoe 152 Degs. This is consistent with the known overburden and leak off tests Both horizontal stresses and fracture gradients are corrected for depletion using: Sh(dP) = Sh - dP where Sh (or correspondingly SH) is minimum (maximum) horizontal stress at initial pressure. Calculating from the Poissons ratio (v); Q (1-2v)/ (1-v), Based on shear sonic data from 34/7-P-42, the value for shows to be 0.75. This value is confirmed by rock mechanical correlation from SAGA's well database (BRD). LOT from the neighbour well 34/7-P-42 suggests that might have be as optimistic as at the time it was drilled, but since considerable amount of time is between this well and 34/7-P-42, stresses might have settled more due to depletion than previously. Therefore the more conservative choice of = has been preferred. The strength log has been found from the density log using correlation (representing the area) between density and strength measurements from cores.

INDIVIDUAL WELL PROGRAMME 34/7-P44 Revision: date 25.01.2000 MUD PROGRAMME7 DIRECTIONAL 7.1 Inclination and Azimuth 34/7-P-44 The well will be kicked off at 1150 MD, right below 18 5/8 shoe. The plan starts with 1,5/30m BUR and the well will be turned to 3 azimuth. At 1581 MD an intermediate sail angle off 56,3 and 3 azimuth is planned, followed by build and turn at 1,5/30m from 3084 MD to 3635 MD building to 70 and turned to 30 azimuth. The well will continue with build and turn at 2/30m from 3635 MD to 3920 MD building to 87 and turning to 38,5 azimuth. This will again be followed up with this sail angle and direction to 4065 MD. Now the plan continue with build and turn with 2,2/30m from 4065 MD to 4590 MD building to 89,4 and turned to 0,0 azimuth. The well has now got the angle, but the well is turned to the final azimuth off TO off this well is planned at 6630mMD, with an angle off 89,36 and 310,4 azimuth. Follow planned build rate rather than concentrate on following the line in the plot. Torque and drag simulations have been performed. The results from this simulation are the basis for the BHA recommendations. For POBM friction factor of in casing and in open hole have been used. This has been determined from analyzing data in previous wells drilled on Snorre TLP. Using drill pipe in the 1/2 section should not create any helical buckling. Estimated torque output during rotation at TO is simulated to be approximately 35 kNm. Drill string design will be altered according to the BHA requirements as drilling commences. 7.2 Survey Program Surveys shall be taken every 30 meters, or on shorter interval if required for directional control. In the 12 1/4 and 1/2 sections the MVVD surveys shall be corrected using the In-Field Referencing technique to help reduce the uncertainty of the surveys as drilling progresses. 7.3 Bottom Hole Assemblies Snorre TLP Revision: Ut Well Program Date: 21.01.00 DIRECTIONAL ilia 34/7-P-44 Page of HYDROBHA's for the 16, 12 1/4 and 1/2 sections are shown in section details.

Cement Acceptance Criteria continued drilling, and to seal off the hydrocarbon bearing reservoir. The acceptance test for continued drilling shall be the minimum leak off value at the intermediate casing. Top of cement is planned to be at 3403 MD, which is 200 MD above Top Staffjord S5 (top reservoir). The zone isolation requirements is as follows: - Between the Lunde and Statfjord Formations (zone isolation). - 200 cement MD above the reservoir (barrier). If the cementing job is performed according to the established procedure and the cementing quality is considered to be satisfactory, no cement acceptance verification will be done. Lost Circulation Lost circulation has occured the last three drilled wells. This section is planned drilled with 1,58 sg mud due to the 1,56 sg pressure in top of the reservoir. Prevent pressure surges that may lead to lost circulation. Separate section recommendations will be written before drilling this section regarding loss circulation and reservoir pressure conditions. 10.3.5 Operational Instructions Drill out cement and shoe with min. sg pseudo oil based mud, the mudweight will be weighted up to sg before drilling into the reservoir. Drill meter new formation and perform an FIT to sg. The wellplan includes 1,5 - 2,030m dogleg through most of the section. Bit TFA should be high enough to secure max flowrate at TD. Total depth of section should be based on rat hole below planned casing shoe depth. After circulating the hole clean at TD, treat the mud to casing specification. In order to avoid washouts in the rathole while circulating to clean the hole, one stand should be backreamed and circulating continued from this depth.

Continue drilling with 1,43 sg - sg. Rotate pipe at optimum (130 RPM) to agitate low side cutting beds. Be aware of increased ECD when increasing the RPM. If possible use flowrate above 1250 Ipm as this has given adequate hole cleaning in 1/2 hole previously. Lost circulation After connections or when circulation has been stopped for more than minutes and before drilling is resumed, rotate pipe without circulation to break the gel strength. Stop rotating and break circulation accorcing to established procedures. Be careful when RIH, rotate pipe without circulation to break the gel strength, then stop rotating before starting to circlate. Start circulation gently. Avoid back reaming unless absolutely required. If mud losses occur, pump PBS pill (X linked polymers). It is not recommended to pump coarse LCM material (150 kg/m3). If added, fibre materials will build stronger filtercake and thus prevent seepage loss. The strongest contribution to high ECD is rheology.

Well 34/7-P-44 is the 18th oil producer to be completed on the Snorre TLP platform. The well will be completed as producer with selective production from specific reservoir zones in the Statfjord and Lunde formation in the northern part of the Western Fault Block (WEB). 11.2 TYPE OF COMPLETION.  P-44 will be completed as producer with selective production from specific reservoir zones. Selectivity will be achieved either by conventional SSD's (Sliding Side Doors) or by DIACS (Downhole Instrumentation And Control System). Permanent pressure and temperature gauge will either be part of the DIACS system, or in case of conventional SSD's as permanent pressure and temperature gauge located above the production packer. The base case completion alternative includes 5/8 casing sat into the reservoir and a 1/2 liner sat to TD. Conventional SSD's or remote operated SSD's provides selectivity between Lunde Fm. and Statfjord Fm. in WFB. If operational problems should occur during drilling the 1/2 hole section, shorter liner will be sat and hole section drilled to TD. The back-up completion alternative, includes 1/2 inner string in the liner and liner to TD. Conventional SSD's or remote operated SSD's provides selectivity between Lunde Fm., Lower Statfjord Fm. and Upper Statfjord Fm. The main completion string is 1/2 20 ppf L-80 13% Cr tubing. The well will be perforated overbalanced and oriented with TCP guns. For other details, see attachments.
