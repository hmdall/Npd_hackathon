The scope of work called for information on seabed and sub-seabed conditions to ensure the safe, secure and efficient installation and operation of jack up rig. TEPN had identified the need to acquire site survey data in order to evaluate the location for the units safe positioning. The survey covered an area measuring nominal 2.0km 2.0km, with primary survey lines orientated 164/344 and secondary survey lines orientated 075/255. Primary line spacing was 100m and secondary line spacing at 200m, 350m and 500m.

All equipment offsets, towpoints and laybacks are included in Appendix of this report. 2.2.1 GNSS System Primary navigation for this project was the Fugro Starfix HP DGNSS system using Rogaland, Aberdeen and Torshavn as the reference stations. Dual independent receivers were used in order to give full redundancy on the systems. The vessel operates with three GNSS receivers: DGNSS Receivers 1 Starpack Fugro Starfix HP corrections 2 Starpack Fugro Starfix HP corrections 3 Seapath 200 Fugro Starfix HP corrections 2.2.2 GNSS Verification A position and height verification was conducted on M.V. Kommandor between 20:27 and 23:27h on 08-Aug-2015 alongside Bergen by comparing all navigation systems. Three navigation systems were logged every second for three hours in the Voyager5 survey computer and processed using the Voyager5 Navcheck software. The following is summary of results between the primary navigation system (Sys1) and each of the other navigation systems logged by Voyager5 for the CoG position. DGNSS Quality Control - Validation Check Navigation system comparison check in port dE dN dH 2.2.3 GNSS Quality Control Quality Control of the DGNSS was maintained on-line by continuously monitoring number of quality indicators provided by Gardline Geosurveys Voyager5 and VGPS software. At the end of each line series of statistics are created in Voyager5 which allow comparison between the prime navigation and the other navigation systems used, and monitor the fix distance and / or shot point distance. VGPS is an in-house QC package that follows the quality measures as recommended in the OGP Guidelines for GNSS positioning in the oil and gas industry. This allows statistics to be produced that confirm that the positioning systems onboard the vessel perform to the required standard. Both software packages showed that the DGNSS systems performed to high standard, and hence positioning accuracy achieved was in accordance with specifications for the systems. Absolute accuracy would, therefore, be in the region of  metres with relative accuracy being greater.2.2.4 USBL Relative Positioning System A HiPAP 500 USBL acoustic tracking system is permanently installed in M.V. Kommandor and was used to position the side scan sonar. A field calibration of the equipment was made on 26-Jul-2015 by observations to seabed transponder. The pitch, roll and alignment corrections were determined by processing the calibration data in the Casius module, and the values determined were entered directly into the HiPAP system. USBL Calibration Values USBL model HiPAP 500 Date of calibration 26-Jul-2015 Pitch Roll Tx alignment -0.28 -0.15 1.16 The USBL system was operated with the transponder located 2m from the side scan sonar fish. It is expected that accuracies in accordance with manufacturers specifications were achieved when data reception was good. It would normally be expected for such system to return accuracies in the order of 1% of slant range. Additionally, composite angular accuracy of about 1.2 is expected. The propagation of these 'errors' results in an expected system accuracy of around 10m. 2.2.5 Survey Computer Navigation control and acquisition was undertaken using Voyager5, proprietary software developed by Gardline Geosurvey. The software is Windows based, running on high-specification PCs with multiple displays. All navigation and associated sensors were interfaced to this system using MOXA multi-serial I/O boards. The system is synchronised to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Pulse per Second (PPS) and associated time-tag from one of the onboard GNSS receivers. As well as recording position data from the GNSS receivers, Voyager5 has position input from the USBL system, depth data from multi and single beam echo sounders, heading data from Seapath and survey gyrocompass, and various inputs from analogue and digital seismic systems such as the bird controller and magnetometer. As for outputs, Voyager5 provides shot commands to the seismic recording package, and time tagged position strings to all analogue and digital seismic recorders. It is also interfaced to the vessels autopilot in order to provide cross-track information to enable the vessel to maintain the programmed line. The Voyager5 system has number of post processing programs for manipulation and QC of the various data recorded. These various programs allow for position data to be output electronically and for both track and single beam bathymetry data to be plotted.2.3 Heading Control 2.3.1 Heading Sensor System The Seatex Seapath 200 system provides motion, heading and position information by integrating data from both inertial and GNSS sensors. The system comprises Seatex MRU-5 inertial measurement system and two Ashtech GNSS carrier phase receivers are mounted on an antenna platform with metre separation along the centre-line of the vessel. Heading is derived from GNSS phase comparison techniques between the two GNSS antennae. The installation on M.V. Kommandor was also interfaced to Navigat MK1 survey gyrocompass for comparison. The use of the gyrocompass within the system improves reliability, as this sensor acts as secondary heading reference should the GNSS signals be temporarily interrupted. The gyrocompass data is constantly monitored by the Seapath processor in order to derive calibration figure for the compass with respect to the GNSS heading. Two figures are calculated, long-term offset between the two sensors, plus short term drift. 2.3.2 Moving Baseline RTK Calibration The Seapath system was installed whilst the vessel was in dry dock, and was calibrated using Topcon HiperPro RTK GNSS system. The calibration procedure involves the calculation of three variables; the Seapath antenna baseline length and height difference, and the heading offset from the centre line of the vessel. The antenna baseline is nominal metres, but this is accurately determined during the calibration. The HiperPro GPS receivers were located on vessel survey monuments (VSMs) at the bow and stern of the vessel, baseline of approximately 43m. These monuments had previously been established using land survey methodology whilst the vessel was in dry dock. One of the receivers was configured as the base and one as the rover. The base receiver computes reference position when initialised accurate to within metres. The rover receiver was configured to output time-tagged NMEA GGA and HDT string giving bearing between the base and the rover. This data was output and recorded to data logger for post-processing. Seapath Installation Values System Alignment Length Height 2.3.3 Heading Sensor Verification During the mobilisation of the project and during survey operations the Navigat MK1 gyrocompass correction was determined whenever the vessel was alongside by undertaking system comparison with the Seapath system. Corrections to the gyrocompass reading were entered into the Voyager5 setup for the Navigat MK1 gyrocompass.

Kommandor and was used to provide swathe bathymetry data.

Attitude data were then examined for erroneous readings. 2.5.2 Depth Processing Tidal information was loaded to the relevant files and the survey lines merged. The merging process combines all sensor data along with tidal and offset information to produce updated soundings files, prior to depth editing. Depth data were processed using the Swathe Editor function, where each line is cleaned manually and statistically for noise. 2.5.3 Gridding and Quality Control The dataset was gridded to create BASE Surface (Bathymetry Associated with Statistical Error) with different child layers to enable further processing and checking using the Subset function. BASE surface is geo-referenced image of multi-attributed, weighted mean surface. The gridding technique used was combination of range and swathe angle weighting. The range weight was inversely proportional to the distance from the node (the position of the node was determined during the creation of the fieldsheet): soundings closer to the node were given more weighting. The swathe angle weighting ensured that higher value was given to beams from the inner part of the swathe than to outer beams from adjacent lines. The surface was created using single resolution of 2m 2m, which was determined by several factors including; system, water depth, line spacing and data quality. The child layers: mean, shoal, deep, density and standard deviation were reviewed for outstanding noise, artifacts and density, which were then updated and finalised for export.Total E&P Norge AS NCS Block 1/5, Solaris Site Survey Gardline Report Ref (Final) 2.5.4 General Processing Sequence Vessel config file Tidal model Setup/test/ apply filters No Raw MBES Data Convert Data to HDCS Examine Attitude Navigation Load Tide Merge (georeference  apply offsets) Create Fieldsheet Create Raw Base Surface Examine data in swathe editor Create Edited Examine artefacts in subset editor Re-merge Create____ Clean Final Grid?

Main instrumental and operating parameters are as follows: Recorder Simrad EA400 Transducer frequencies 38 and 200kHz Digital output 38kHz Waterline and transducer depth measurements are measured at CoG. The Seapath calculates the heave, pitch and roll of the vessel relative to the CoG. All heave, pitch and roll data are then output to the SBES and MBES systems from the Seapath with lever arms applied. Therefore any depth adjustments have to relate to CoG so that static offset relative to the trim of the vessel at the time of draught measurement is not erroneously applied. Date Time Port Starboard Mean Reference Level Waterline offset Draft The echo sounder was operated using the mean speed of sound. Single beam echo sounder data have been used to validate the multi-beam echo sounder data, but have not been charted in this report.2.7 Velocity Information The M.V.

A single point co-tidal model was used for this survey. Single Point Co-Tidal Model MHWI MSR Port +00:56 Proposed Location +02:06 Time difference Range ratio Co-tidal values +01:10 The time zone at Aberdeen is 0000 and the survey was conducted in zone 0000; therefore no time correction was applied to the data. The difference between LAT and MSL at the proposed location is 0.6m, with maximum predicted tidal range of 1.2m.2.9 Side Scan Sonar A dual channel side scan sonar system was used to scan the seabed to locate and identify seabed obstructions and to investigate seabed soil properties and boundaries. Main instrumental and operating parameters are as follows: Side scan system EdgeTech 4200 Towfish EdgeTech 4200FS Graphic recorder Octopus Ultra 120 Digital recorder Octopus 760D Horizontal Beamwidth 0.3 Vertical Beamwidth 50 Depression Angle 10 Frequency 120/410kHz Range 125m Maximum cover 400% Minimum cover 100% Side Scan Sonar Data Processing and Mosaic Creation The side scan sonar data were loaded into Gardline Geosurveys GeoFusion software. The seabed was tracked, and Time Varying Gains (TVG) were applied to the data. Corrected navigation was applied to the side scan sonar lines, and rolling heading applied. The water column was removed from the side scan sonar lines using slant range correction. The side scan sonar lines were layered, because if merged, the image would appear blurred, compromising data quality. Further TVG adjustments were then made to try and balance the side scan sonar mosaic across the lines. The side scan sonar mosaics were exported at pixels per metre resolution. Side Scan Sonar Object Picking Criteria Seabed objects were interpreted from the corrected data using Gardline Geosurveys GeoFusion software rather than using the side scan sonar mosaic, which allowed the data to be reviewed at higher resolution. Objects with hard responses and measurable height (i.e. well defined shadow) have been picked. If an object only meets one of these criteria then it has not been picked. Only objects with height of 0.3m have been mapped and presented as boulders. Objects have been classed as debris where the length or width of the object was measureable, or where magnetometer anomaly is associated.3. SHALLOW DATA ASSESSMENT The geophysical data have been interpreted to produce fully integrated dataset. The limitations and reliability of the geophysical data have been assessed in this section. Seabed conditions were interpreted from multi-beam echo sounder and side scan sonar data. The resolution of the multi-beam bathymetry data was 2m 2m, which was determined by several factors, including system, water depth, line spacing and data quality. All significant seabed features, such pipelines and spudcan depressions were imaged on bathymetry data. The range and resolution of side scan sonar data are the main constraints on the features that can be observed on the seabed. Sonar contacts with minimum detectable height of .2-0.3m were observed on the 125m range lines.APPENDICESAPPENDIX EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE AND INTERPRETATIONMulti-beam Echo Sounder The theory of operation of conventional, or single beam, echo sounder (SBES) is relatively straightforward. An acoustic pulse is transmitted, reflected from the seabed below the vessel, and the returned pulse detected at the transducer. This time-of-flight is precisely measured, and by application of the speed of sound in seawater, this two-way travel time may be converted to distance, and displayed in feet or metres. To determine the speed of sound in seawater, sound velocity profile is observed through the water column, and the mean velocity is sufficient to convert the measured travel time to distance. The beam-width of SBES transducer is typically in the range of 7-20 degrees. This enables the echo sounder to report the minimum (vertical) depth below the vessel even when the vessel is subjected to considerable pitch and roll motion. In this respect pitch and roll usually have limited affect on the quality of the measured depth, but the heave of the vessel is significant influence. heave compensator is used to measure and remove the vessel heave. The multi-beam echo sounder (MBES) is considerably more complex. Instead of measuring single depth below the transducer, it is capable of measuring multiple depths across wide swathe, orientated across the axis of the vessel. The term swathe echo sounder is sometimes used to describe these types of sounder. In fact, this is a more generic term, and encompasses both the interferometer and the multi-beam sounder. The interferometric echo sounder works on slightly different principle and is not considered here. The transducer of an MBES system has two components, the transmit (Tx) and the receive (Rx) array, although in some systems these are combined into one physical transducer. The EM1000 and EM1002 are such systems. The Tx array transmits wide acoustic pulse in the across-ship direction. The width of this pulse determines the swathe width. Typical values are 120-150 degrees. The width of the Tx pulse in the along-ship direction is an important factor in determining the resolution of the system. The Tx beam width is typically 1-4 degrees. In an MBES, the receive array is used to form the discrete beams that are employed to determine individual depths. The array does not physically have series of beams, but these are formed electronically, in process called electronic beam steering. The number of formed beams, and hence measured depths, is typically 50-200. Each beam is formed with narrow angle in the across- ship direction. This is the Rx beam width, and typical values are 1-4 degrees. As with the conventional echo sounder, the MBES determines range to the seabed from measurement of elapsed time. However, the mean velocity through the water column is no longer sufficient, and the complete profile must be used in the calculations. This is because only few central beams approach the vertical; most beams travel at an angle to the vertical, and such beams are bent as they pass through layers of different velocity. The amount of bending is described by Snells Law, and the modelling of this path through the water column is termed ray tracing. Thus the measurement and application of sound velocity is critical to the accuracy of the MBES system. In addition, it is no longer sufficient to measure just the heave of the survey vessel, but precise measurements of pitch, roll, heave and heading are essential to correctly orientate the swathe of depths.Side scan Sonar The effectiveness of this system can be gauged primarily by the following variables - range, detectability, resolution and plotting accuracy. Range is fundamental property and is determined, in the first instance, by choice of instrument and second, by operational range setting. This decision will affect the other variables; an increase in range generally degrading the other three. For any given range, the detectability is determined by number of factors, none of which are very easy to quantify. Manufacturer's tables may only be used as very rough guide, since they have to make assumptions as to beamwidth, usually defined as 3dB down from the peak value. Hence powerful contact will frequently generate return from outside the nominal beamwidth (or, for that matter, outside the range setting in use). In practical terms detectability is determined by the shape, attitude, size and hardness of the target, whether it is hollow and, if so, what it contains, its range, the towing height of the sonar fish, the vessel's speed, the complexity and reflection strength (i.e. the clutter) of the surrounding seabed and the water depth. Water depth, together with the prevailing weather, largely determines the amount of interference from sea and vessel noise. In some circumstances transient factors, such as Lloyd's mirror effects and the presence of fish shoals can further reduce detectability. Resolution, both vertical and horizontal is affected by most of the factors mentioned, although not always in like manner. In favourable conditions, sonars commonly used in site survey operations can often detect thin linear objects, such as cables and wires. More generally, vertical projection of to 10 cm above seabed and to metres across is often visible, provided good reflecting surface is present facing the sonar fish at the optimum range of roughly to times towfish height above seabed, on an otherwise clear seabed. The size of such an object might ideally be measured in terms of the nearest 10 to 20 cm vertically and or metres horizontally. Similarly resolution between adjacent objects would be less accurate still, probably requiring separation of metres or more. Positioning accuracy is also problematical, although this is predominantly overcome by the use of USBL fish tracking systems.

The purpose of the patch test was to verify the installation values already installed in the EM710 derived from previous patch test carried out on the 26-Jul-2015. The patch test consisted of leaving the current motion sensor offset values in the EM710 SIS acquisition software, and running the standard set of patch test lines. The patch test site consisted of slope located approximately 35km off the East coast of the UK. The slope site was chosen due past hydrographic surveys conducted. The immediate seabed around the wreck was relatively flat making the site suitable to resolve all factors; position latency, pitch, roll and alignment. The calibration lines were planned using the Voyager5 PlanIT program, with the patch test data being acquired using the Kongsberg SIS acquisition software, and the calibration factor being determined in the SIS calibration module. verification was then undertaken with these new values entered into SIS, and processed using Caris HIPS and SIPS version 8.1. The following calibration values were determined: Date Time Pitch Roll Alignment Date Transducer Roll Pitch AlignmentWreck Location All coordinates quoted in the report are with respect to European Datum 1950 / International Ellipsoid, UTM Grid Zone 31N (3 East). All water depths are reduced to Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT).The weather on site for the duration of the calibration was calm, with winds SW3 and 0.5m swell. Conditions remained stable throughout. Velocity (m/s-1) Mean Downcast Mean Upcast Mean Velocity Mean Velocity at MBES Head A visual comparison was made between the data from the velocity cast and that read directly at the MBES transducer heads, where it was found that both were to agree within 0.1ms-1. The following settings in the Runtime Parameters menu in SIS were used whilst running the patch test lines: Sector Coverage System Mode Port Starboard Sonar Head 65 65 Beam Spacing: HIDENS EQDIST The following values were input to the SiS calibration module prior to line running: Date Time Roll Pitch Alignment 26-Jul-2015 0s 0.14 -0.28 0.60The calibration areas were chosen to evaluate the different calibration factors using various criteria as follows:  Precise surface positioning.  Uniform water mass, avoiding areas with marked thermoclines.  Calibration performed in good survey weather.  Flat area for evaluation of roll error.  Significant seabed feature for evaluation of the pitch, time delay and heading error. In the determination of angular errors, the greater the water depth, the more apparent the system errors become in the bathymetric data, and the easier they are to evaluate. A significant linear feature, such as wreck or ridge is desirable to evaluate any positioning delay. To reduce the effect of any angular errors it is preferable to find such feature in shallower water. Below describes the methods used for determining each set of results. The following stages have to be completed in the order shown as each has an impact on the results in the following stage. 2.4.1 Time Delay Two sets of survey lines were run in the same direction at different speeds over significant feature. The calibration programme overlaid longitudinal profiles from the first set of lines and the two lines were manually adjusted until the profiles matched. The result was verified using the second set of lines surveyed at different speed. Side View Survey Line Seabed Plan View Calibration Corridor2.3.2 Pitch Survey lines were run in opposite directions over significant feature and the calibration programme was then used to determine the pitch correction. The programme required longitudinal profile concentrating on the nadir beams to determine the correction by manually adjusting the factor until the two lines matched. 2.3.3 Roll Calibration Survey lines were run in opposite directions over flat seabed. The calibration programme was then used to determine the roll correction using profile across the full swathe by manually adjusting the angular correction until the two lines matched. Survey Flat Seabed Plan View Survey Line2.3.3 Horizontal Alignment Calibration The horizontal alignment error may be evaluated by: Using pronounced feature on the seabed, pass this feature on opposite sides so that the feature appears in the outer beams on both occasions. Plotting the data from these two lines, the feature should appear in the same position on both data sets. An apparent along track displacement can be used to determine the horizontal correction. The lines chosen for this are run in the same direction at the same speed, to eliminate time delay and pitch effects. Side View Plan View Corridor Survey Line3. RESULTS 3.1 Latency (Time Delay) The latency was determined by running the same line in same direction at diifferent speeds of and 6 knots, the picture below shows the longitudinal profile taken over the feature. A latency correction value of sec was derived, showing that there is no timing delay in the system. This is because the EM710 on the MV Kommandor is setup to receive PPS directly from the Starpack DGNSS system, therefore there is no need to correct for any in latency.3.2 Pitch To determine the pitch correction, the survey line was run twice in opposite idirections at knots of line directions 120.0 and 300.0. The picture below show the longitudinal sectional profiles with the current offset applied. All data tied in well and verified the offsets applied.3.3 Roll The roll correction was determined, by running the same line twice, once in each direction (120.0 and 300.0 at speed of knots. The pictures below show the cross sectional profiles without any correction and with correction applied. A correction of -0.19 was determined.3.4 Alignment To determine the alignment line at speed of k.nots. images below show the long correction two lines were run, offset by 130.0m to the side of the centre In this case both lines were run in the same direction of 300.0.

Current values as entered into HiPAP Pitch Roll Heading Derived calibration results 18-Oct-2014 Derived calibration results 23-Jan-2014 Previous calibration results 23-Jul-2013  Introduction The HiPAP 500 SSBL system is permanent installation on the MV Kommandor. full calibration of the system was carried out on the 26th July 2015 in accordance with Gardline procedure 338/SUR. The calibration itself comprised running figure of eight triangular pattern. Data acquired from this acquisition plan was then run through the APOS (Kongsberg HiPAP operation / acquisition software) to produce alignment corrections for the pitch, roll and gear (heading) of the HiPAP transducer head. The calibration was performed 70km to the east of the UK, in approx 80m water depth. Weather conditions were good (wind SSE 3, swell m). Surveyor: Stynes 04-Aug-2015 X,Y,Z coordinates of the USBL transducer Delta heading - (8 z), the horizontal angle in degrees to correct the 0 of the USBL to the ships centreline (y-axis). Note that this correction is independent of the heading sensor for which separate alignment correction is deduced, delta pitch - (8 x), the vertical angle in degrees to correct the xy plane of the SSBL to horizontal, delta roll - (8 y), the vertical angle in degrees to correct the xy plane of the USBL to horizontal, delta range - an index correction, scale factor - (p), factor to correct for velocity error, delta time - deskewing correction to compensate for system time lag. Prior to the USBL calibration all associated sensors, instruments and offsets are calibrated/verified according to the relevant procedures. Offsets from the transducer to the CoG were set in the APOS Kongsberg software; X = 0.63m Y = 9.57m Z = 6.51m The ships navigation system was only used for line guidance during the calibration. All data was logged in the HiPAP system, with calibration values calculated in the APOS Kongsberg software  Method Prior to deployment beacon to the seabed, full water depth velocity recorded (mean value m/s) and entered into the APOS system. The transponder was deployed on the seabed with floatation collar/mounting frame to maintain the transponder in stable upright position. The length of the strop was measured prior to deployment, to obtain an accurate height of the transponder above the seabed. Deployment of the beacon was monitored and checked throughout to minimise the chance of the ground gear being fouled on deployment or to prevent damage to the equipment or injury to personnel. See the diagram below of the USBL ground gear deployed.Acoustic release beacon housed in floatation collar, also attach an appropriate length of rope to bolts that secure the floatation collar to aid recovery with boat hook or with similar device, when beacon returns to the surface Shackle attached to acoustic release resin block Weighted anchorage consisting of three weights strung together with wire strop and secured to main wire strop with shackle Total length of beacon deployment rig = 2.80m Main wire strop approximately 1.5m in length, attached to shackle on acoustic release block Deployment of the beacon was carried out using the crane located on the aft deck port side of the MV Kommandor, where the lifting rope was attached to the crane hook. Once the beacon was over the side, it was gently lowered. When the crane hook was at about eye level the rope was then cut, sending the beacon to the seabed. The whole deployment was monitored and checked to minimise the chance of the anchoring gear being fouled on deployment or to prevent damage to the equipment or injury to personnel. Calibration The calibration lines were created using Voyager5 software in the figure of eight triangles centred on the reference position for the beacon on the seabed (method recommended by Kongsberg) see Figure Figure Before data were logged calibration factors were changed in APOS to (0,0,0) The logging was done when the vessel was moving in four straight lines with the speed 3.0kts, so the pattern was simple for the steersman. All lines were done twice in opposite directions to improve quality of the calibration. Data for each line was logged directly into the APOS USBL system software, which was later processed.

Two lines were run as confirmation. The first line was run out approximately 500m from the beacon and still gave good results Hdg 180. The second line was run out approximately 800m from the beacon and still gave good results Hdg 270. The verification lines produced satisfactory results for the accuracy of beacon tracking.

The Kongsberg manual suggests that the best method for performing calibration is the `cardinal points' method. This method is only possible when operating the vessel in DP mode as it requires the vessel to be in fixed locations with fixed headings. As the DP system was not available to use it was decided that we should adopt the alternate method recommended by Kongsberg ie; the figure of eight triangles.
