INTRODUCTION N:\ 1.1 SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF STUDY This report covers the Jurassic section of 58 wells drilled0in the ngrthern North Sea. These0 wells lie within the area bounded by latitute 62 to 56 and longitude to E. Of these, 19 wells have been drilled on the U.K. side of the North Sea and 15 on the Norwegian side. The aim of this report is twofold: to provide detailed biostratigraphic, petrographic and petroleum geochemical data for the Jurassic sections of these wells; ii to provide synthesis of these data in terms of the palaeogeography, extent and facies of the Jurassic. The synthesis thus provided is necessarily incomplete as no seismic nor structural information was available for integration. It is hoped, however, that these data and their interpretation will bQ of assistance in enabling more complete picture of the Jurassic of the northern North Sea to be developed. 1.2 ARRANGEMENT OF REPORT AND ENCLOSURES The report consists of three volumes. Volume is the text of the report, volume photomicrographs of representative thin sections investigated petrographically and volume consists of detailed stratigraphic, core description and petroleum geochemistry charts. fence diagram, regional stratigraphic sections and maps are enclosed in volumes and 2. All charts, sections, maps, etc, are called enclosures. Within volume 1, the major part of the text consists of appendices giving details of the work done, appendix IV providing data on well-by-well basis. Within this appendix and within volume 3, the wells are arranged in numerical order. 1.3 WELLS AND DATA INCLUDED IN THE STUDY The wells studied are shown on the index map to volume 3. Ditch cuttings were supplied from approximately 100 feet above the Jurassic and 100 feet below it. In practice, as described in section below, samples to approximately 100 feet below the top of red beds or other lithological criteria were examined. Sidewall samples were also available in certain wells. All cores were visually examined and by arrangement certain core samples were provided for investigation. In the vast majority of cases one log (usually composite or induction/sonic) was also made available on strictly confidential arrangement. These logs were on widely varying set of scales, but since they were provided primarily in order to allow us to make more intelligent interpretation of ditch, cuttings, this was not important. 4/76Phillips and Amoco preferred that we should not be supplied with logs and the interpretation of wells operated by these companies is thus made on the basis of the available samples. The biostratigraphic range chart (enclosure 3) has been compiled trom RRI studies of additional wells drilled in the northern North Sea, but no confidential information is divulged as result. It must be stressed that since RRI had no access to structural data all interpretations are based on well information only: Since these wells are normally drilled in crestal positions on structures, the sections penetrated, which have been used as basis for interpretation, are typical for this structural position only and more complete stratigraphic columns would be expected to be penetrated downdip. 1.4 METHODS OF WORK Details of the biostratigraphic, petrographic and petroleum geochemical methods of work are given in appendices Ito III. Great emphasis was placed upon cooperation between the various stratigraphers working on different groups of organisms, and between them and the sedimentologists in order to arrive at logical interpretation of the data. This cooperation which has been maintained during subsequent work has resulted in the evolution and crystallisation of some ideas concerning the stratigraphy and its interpretation. The changes to the original interpretations which resulted from this evolution have been incorporated on the enclosures and are discussed in chapter 3. This has resulted in more consistent and rational interpretation of the available data. The lithology of the ditch cuttings was redescribed in order to construct consistent lithological columns. Although in many cases some log data were available, it was finally decided that the depths of cuttings logged should be those indicated on the ditch-cutting bags, since there were generally insufficient data to make complete reinterpretation. This method has the advantage that depths on slides in the RRI collection refer directly to the depths shown on the stratigraphic charts. In only one or two cases did there appear to be any important variations in depth compared with log depths, and these are noted in appendix W. Since correlations between wells are represented by straight lines the wells are placed equidistant one from another on the stratigraphic sections. The types of correlation lines shown on these sections are an indication of the evidence used to define the lines. 1.5 PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE STUDY Many staff contributed to the project, amongst whom may be mentioned: Lithological Descriptions C.

STRATIGRAPHY The biostratigraphy of the wells in the study is plotted on the charts in volume and is explained in Appendix 1. These data have been used to compile a fence diagram (enclosure 38) and the stratigraphic sections (enclosures 39 to 45). In addition to these, three maps showing environments of deposition (figures to 4) have been compiled. The general stratigraphy and geology of the North Sea have been described in various papers in Woodland (1975) Finstad and Selley (1975) and also in joint IGS/Department of Energy paper (Brooks and Chesher, 1975). It was decided at the outset of this study not to refer to lithostratigraphic units as general rule, owing to the variations and poor definition of them in the available literature. Environments of deposition and the criteria for deducing them are described in section and in Appendix II. Palynofacies determinations are of value environmentally and methods for distinguishing them are described in section 2. 5. The major biostratigraphic units distinguished during the study are shown on the stratigraphic sections. However, there are many other biostratigraphic events on the stratigraphic charts in volume which can be used to give more detailed well-to-well correlations than those shown on the sections. Particular points relating to the lithology and general stratigraphy of the Jurassic are discussed below while general geological descriptions of the Lower to Upper Jurassic can be found in Chapter 3. 2.1 STAGES AND SUBDIVISIONS OF THE JURASSIC 2. 1. 1. COMPARISON WITH ONSHORE STRATIGRAPHY The stage names used in this report are shown on the range chart (enclosure 3, volume 3). The ammonite zonation of these stages is shown on Table which is taken from the RRI onshore report. However, since compiling that report it has been decided that the term 'Volgian' should be used for the uppermost stage in the Jurassic of the North Sea. Since the Portlandian stage has generally been used by oil companies working in the area, reasons for using the Volgian stage are considered at some length. 2.1.a. THE USE OF THE TERM VOLGIAN (figure 1) By late Jurassic times, certain groups of invertebrates, in particular the ammonites, had become segregated in the northern hemisphere into two main geographical realms (Arkell 1956; Hallam 1969, 1971; Casey 1971). southern or Tethyan realm was centred on the circum-global Tethys with Boreal realmI SU8 SY EM ST STA GE ZO ; UPPER JURASSIC PORTLANDiAN (Ostracode zones) Titanites giganteus Glaucolithites gorei Progalbanites albani KImMERIDGIAN UPPER Pavlovia rotunda Pavlovia pallasioides Pectinatites pectinatus Pectinatites hudlestoni MIDDLE LOWER  I.

(1969), in International Field Symposium on the British Jurassic. 1. Zones of the Lower Jurassic follow Dean, Donovan & Howarth (1961). I LI 2. The Pliensbachian has been subdivided into Carixian and Domerian following Arkell (1933). 3. Zones of the Bajocian and Aalenian are in course of revision in Britain. The Aalenian here has been included in the Bajocian. 4. Zones of the Bathonian follow Torrens (1967b). 5. Zones of the Callovian and Lower Oxfordian follow Callomon (1964); those of the Upper Oxfordian are still somewhat uncertain in England, for discussion and correlation with the Jura see Enay (1966). 6. Zones of the Kimmeridgian follow Ziegler (1962), Cope (1967) and Casey (1967). 7. Zones of the Portlandian follow Arkell (1956) and Casey (1967). 8. Top of the Jurassic is taken at the base of the Cinder Bed (Purbeck Beds) in Dorset (base of the Speeton Clay in Yorkshire). This zonal and stage scheme is that used in the RRI onshore Jurassic report. The same stages have been used in the present report, with the exception that the term Volgian - the equivalent of the Middle/Upper Kimmeridgian and Portlandian (see figure 1) - is introduced here.Efl 123 II an =1 JIM 11111 IR ill MI al IN MO NM IR oissvanr S11030V/380 A8VON1109 NOI1V-138800 AO .12:1VHO JU RASSIC CRETACEOUS sysTEm STAGE KIM MER1DGIAN LOWER VOLGIC.N MIDDLE VOLGIAN UPPER VOLGIAN RYAZANIAN VALANGINIAN HAUTERIVIAN BOREAL SCHEME ( CASEY 1971 AND HEREIN) K IMMERIDGIAN PORTLANDIAN BERRIASIAN VALANGINIAN HAUTERiviAN ENGLISH SCHEME (ARKELL 1933) LOWER MIDDLE  UPPER KIMMERIDGIAN TITHONIAN -.0 BERRIASIAN VALANGINIAN HAuTERiviAN TETHYAN SCHEME (CASEY 1973) -0 Not applicable to this study THIS STUDY Cu KIMMERIDGE  xr  - CLAY ; lti  0  an, PORTLAND BEDS PuRBECK BEDS ' WEALDEN BEDS .

The geographical boundary between the two realms was gradational and appears to have oscillated somewhat with time: it generally corresponds in Europe with what is now the Alpine fold belt. Correlation between Boreal and Tethyan stages is unsatisfactory. Contemporary late Jurassic stratigraphic terminology is somewhat confused as different authors have either utilised the same terms with different age connotations or have introduced variety of terms to describe sections of equivalent age. The position is much the same for the basal Cretaceous, there being no satisfactory correlation between the Boreal Ryazanian and the Tethyan Berrias ian stages. Since the North Sea lies wholly in the Boreal realm the problem here should centre on the delimitation and inter-relationship of Kimmeridgian, Portlandian/ Volgian and Ryazanian stages. In this study the term Ryazanian is used for the basal stage of the Cretaceous and the term Volgian for the top Jurassic stage. The base of the Volgian stage is taken at the level of the Gravesia horizon (the P. elegans zone or Cope 1967) following the usage of Casey (1971). The Kimmeridgian stage is accordingly restricted to the Lower Kimmeridgian (P. baylei to the base of the P. elegans zo:le) as defined by Cope (1967). The Kimmeri,igian-Portlandian stages are currently defined in sections in southern England where facies control is very marked and there is considerable lateral variation. The boundary between the two stages is coarsening-up lithofacies boundary and it is accordingly very difficult even at the type sections to define on palynofloral or microfaunal evidence. Many of the palynofloral changes near the boundary in southern England are simply response to the change in facies. The upper Portlandian in Dorset is high-energy carbonate sequence, transitional to the essentially non-marine facies of the Purbeck and Wealden beds of late Jurassic - early Cretaceous age. Recently the term Purbeckian, which refers to non-marine facies unit spanning the Jurassic - Cretaceous boundary, has been abandoned as stage in favour of its use as facies unit. Microfloral and microfaunal assemblages from the southern England Upper Jurassic are accordingly atypical and do not readily allow for correlation with the generally continuous marine sequence encountered in the North Sea. Furthermore, a number of microfloral taxa common in the North Sea late Jurassic are not represented and the microfaunas show little similarity to those in the Kimmeridgian - Portlandian of southern England. 4/762.2 THE UPPER AND LOWER BOUNDARIES OF THE JURASSIC 2. 2.1. THE UPPER BOUNDARY Throughout much of the area studied, the Cretaceous-Jurassic boundary lies within marine beds and is an evident unconformity. This is in contrast to certain onshore sections, such as Dorset, where the fossil content does not clearly define the position of the boundary. 2. 2. 2. THE LOWER BOUNDARY When the Jurassic lies unconformably on pre-Triassic sediments, the boundary can, for the most part, be clearly distinguished lithologically. However, in most of the wells studied unfossiliferous or poorly fossiliferous continental sediments underlie the Jurassic; whereas in the Viking graben this lower boundary is apparently conformable, elsewhere it is generally unconformable. In the western part of the northern Viking graben the oldest Jurassic stratigraphic unit (unit z) is not definitely recognised and this is interpreted as result of these lowest Jurassic beds being of continental facies. Jurassic continental sediments therefore rest conformably on Triassic continental sediments and because of lack of fossil evidence the boundary between the Jurassic and Triassic cannot usually be identified. In some wells there are hundreds of feet of sediment before clearly dated Triassic is reached and it was not felt that the present study warranted investigation of this thick unfossiliferous section. Palaeontological study was therefore terminated when sediments of presumed continental origin were encountered and the following criteria were used to define the base of the interval studied: brick-red and brownish red shale and marl which is often silty and sandy; light green waxy or micaceous shale, subordinate to red shale, occasionally mottled red and green; poorly sorted friable feldspathic sandstones which contain angular white, orange and pink quartz and feldspar, and often have soft white calcareous and/or clay matrix. These sediments and those lying below them are marked ?Triassic on the charts and sections of this report. Where Middle Jurassic overlies red beds of typical Triassic aspect there is clearly an unconformity present and the age of the underlying sediments may well be Triassic. However, the age cannot be proved and these beds are also marked ?Triassic on the charts.2.3. NOTES ON SELECTED LMTOLOGICAL MARKERS AND UNITS WITHIN THE JURASSIC 2. 3. LITHOLOGICAL MARKERS C-A IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE JURASSIC In the Lower and Middle Jurassic of the northern part of the Viking graben four lithological marker horizons designated C, B, A', and have been recognised and used as an aid to correlation. Horizon is very widespread marker occurring in the interval late Sinemurian - Carixian. It is characterised by poorly sorted sand which is sometimes cemented or coated with siderite. Chamositic, sideritic and calcareous ooliths are also present in small or moderate amounts. This horizon is recognised from ditch cuttings only and has no distinct log pattern. Horizon B, present in the early Toarcian, is less distinct and is confined to the east-central part of the area. It is recognised by the presence of ooliths in association with limestone or dolomite and subordinate sand. In the late Toarcian shales there is often thin glauconitic or chamositic interval termed A'. This tends to be confined to the west of the area. Horizon A, which occurs at the base of the Bajocian, is coarse, often pebbly sand body and is recognisable over most of the northern Viking graben both from ditch cuttings and from logs. 2. 3. SAND UNITS 3, AND IN THE MIDDLE JURASSIC OF THE VIKING GRABEN The Middle Jurassic sands of the Viking graben can be divided into three on a lithological basis. These litholigical units subsequently proved to have great environmental significance, and are equivalent to the Lower, Middle and Upper Brent Sands of Bowen (1975). The lowest unit is designated 3. This consists of sands, often micaceous, especially in the lower part. These beds are marine throughout and characteristically contain cross bedding structures indicating current activity. The overlying unit is designated 2. It is recognised by the association of interbedded sands, shales and coals. From core data variety of delta-top environments are recognised. Sand unit is the highest division and consists of friable often locally coarse grained sandstones with occasional thin shales. In cores this unit is noted for its bioturbation by diverse assemblage of burrowing forms.2. 3. HOT MIA T. ES One of the most striking features of parts of the Upper Jurassic sediments in the northern North Sea is their high level of natural radioactivity. These fine grained sediments have become known as the hot shales. The hot shales are commonly overlain by Cretaceous carbonates and shales and underlain by calcareous Upper Jurassic sediments with fairly consistent level of natural radioactivity, in the region of 40 API units. In the shaly interval of the Upper Jurassic the level of natural radioactivity may increase from somewhat less than 50 API units in the southern area, to over 150 API units in the extreme north. t. These hot shales are characterised by high organic content and various trace elements which appear to be related to the organic content (Dunn 1972, 1974). Palynological analysis of organic residues indicates that amorphous sapropelic matter, often bituminous in character, is the dominant kerogen. Organic walled microfossils (spores, pollen, dinoflagellate cysts) also occur but are generally very infrequent, poorly preserved and, by comparison with the amorphous sapropel, constitute very little of the total visible kerogen. In certain areas, highly organic-rich limestone bands are developed within these hot shales, where the carbonate content is predominantly derived from calcareous algae (coccoliths). Highly bituminous sapropel-rich sediments (i.e. Kimmeridge clay) are characterised by high bromine and iodine content (Cosgrove 1970). These two elements are common constituents of marine plant (algal) life, and the remains of marine algae have probably therefore contributed much to the high organic content of these sediments. Relatively high concentrations of copper, zinc, iron and phosphorus (Dunn, 1972) are also evidently associated in some way with the preservation of abundant organic (predominantly algal) debris in the sediments. It is likely that trace elements, such as actinium and the previously mentioned bromine and iodine, are primarily responsible for the pronounced radioactivity. It has been suggested that the hot shales represent palaeoenvironment where superabundance of marine algal life flourished, perhaps fossil analogue of present day red tides. Species of dinoflagellates and/or diatoms are responsible for red tides, but these organisms tend to be deficient in halogens. The high content of bromine and iodine together with the unstructured and amorphous nature of the sapropelic debris (probably not derived from structured sporopollenin) suggests that the organic matter was derived from the degradation of colonial algal colonies (seaweed). These may have flourished in ?shallow protected marine environment. It is also possible that some of the bituminous organic material was produced by degradation of organic matter in coastal swamps and lagoons and subsequently redistributed in colloidal form into the marine environment. Suitable conditions at the site of deposition are crucial in order to preserve the abundant organic materials. It is suggested that bottom conditions were somewhat anaerobic with restricted circulation as evidenced by the occurrence of pyrite mineral grains and their pressure marks on palynomorphs. Colloidal organic matter probably accumulated more rapidly than mud.The change from normal sediments to hot shales can be ascribed to reduction in bottom circulation and the development of anaerobic conditions, perhaps associated with algal blooms, with colloidal organic matter abundant and accumulating at the expense of terrigenous sedimentary materials. Changes in circulation, an increase in the depositional enenergy of the environment and an associated increase in terrigenous sediments would accordingly terminate deposition of the hot shales. The development and distribution of these hot shales accordingly appears to be related to certain environmental changes whiCh need not have been isochronous. This is emphasised by the fact that radioactive shales are developed in certain regions of the North Sea in the Liassic, the marine Middle Jurassic and the early Cretaceous. The gamma ray shift in these instances may not, however be as positive as in the late Jurassic hot shales. 2.4 UN CONFOR mn IES A number of stratigraphic breaks can be distinguished but since no structural or seismic sections nor dipmeter logs were available there is no direct evidence to indicate whether the unconformities are angular or not. From the literature and from general study it is however clear that a) at least on certain structures in the Viking graben there is an angular unconformity at the top of the Middle Jurassic sands and b) on regional scale the Kimmerian 'inconformity or unconformities are angular. Study of wells drilled on the 2/5 block shows that uplift and erosion at the top of the Middle Jurassic sands took place during the Bathonian stage. It is only because several wells on one structure have been studied that this is apparent. Where only one well on structure is studied - which is usual - palaeontology cannot confirm the presence of important stratigraphic breaks unless stratigraphic units are wholly absent. 2.4.1. MIDDLE/UPPER JURASSIC A stratigraphic break or breaks appears to be fairly widespread close to the Middle/Upper Jurassic boundary. In the Piper area the youngest sediments underlying the unconformity are of Bathonian age while Callovian or younger sediments occur above it. In the Viking graben area there is more than one break and the lower one may represent the same stratigraphic hiatus as that in the Piper area. a) Piper Area In the Piper field area, Bathonian deltaic shales are typically overlain by marine silty shales followed by the Piper Sand. The Piper sand is of Kimmeridgian - Oxfordian age and the lower shale horizon within this sand unit has yielded ammonites of an uppermost Oxfordian age (Williams et al. 1975). The basal part of the sand and the silty shale which underlies it have proved problematical from the biostratigraphic point of view. There is an obvious breakbetween the marine silty shale below the Piper Sand and the underlying non-marine Bathonian but the extent of this break is difficult to determine. Palynomorph and micropalaeontological recovery have proved poor over this interval but the last definite assemblage recorded indicates an Oxfordian (unit q) age. Rare examples of Chytroeisphaeridia sp. were, however, recorded from certain wells. This is a distinctive morphotype which is generally typical of the early Oxfordian and Callovian. The presence of this form has led to the conclusion that unit r(early Oxfordian) and possibly part of (Callovian) sediments may be present. b) Viking graben area I. The earliest of the two unconformities recognised near the Middle/Upper Jurassic boundary in the Viking graben area occurs at the top of the Middle Jurassic sands within the Bathonian in the 2/5 field. This unconformity could well be more widespread than we have noted but the evidence for it would only be found from detailed studies of individual fields. We have mapped second unconformity within the overlying shales in the south-east part of the Viking Graben. The youngest-sediments below the unconformity are interpreted as being of Callovian age (unit s) while late Oxfordian (unit,p) or younger sediments lie above it. This unconformity has also been recognised by Shell in the Brent field (see Bowen 1975, figure 4) and the unconformity there marks the boundary between the Brent Shale member and the overlying Kimmeridge Clay. Where black late Jurassic shales rest on black Callovian shales the break may or may not be recognisable by subtle changes in palynofacies. It does, however, appear to be clearly recognisable in the majority of cases by microfaunal changes. 2. 4. 2. UPPER JURASSIC AND UPPER JURASSIC/CRETACEOUS The Kimmeridgian-Volgian succession is far from complete within most of the North Sea and northwest Europe. The succession in any given well is frequently fragmented, with sections cut out by non-sequences or unconformities of regional and/or local extent. By comparison with well-dated onshore sections these regional non-sequences can be dated in terms of Boreal stage nomenclature. Three non-sequences - Kimmeridgian/Volgian, middle Volgian and late Volgian - have been recognised or suggested in onshore sequences of Britain and France. The regional non-sequences occurred during the so-called Kimmerian orogenic movements and are considered to be due to uplift. This resulted from movements within the Caledonian belt with possible subsequent movements of re-adjustment along the Hercynian front (Casey 1971). Less pronounced, but related earth movements appear to have been responsible for the cyclic/rhythmic sedimentation characteristic of many onshore late Jurassic sedimentary sequences (Dunn 1972, 1974; Riley 1974). The non-sequences may also be linked, at least in part, with rifting which preceded Atlantic opening (Dunn 1972). a) KimmericlE.);ian/Volian A non-sequence/stratigraphic hiatus occurs in the early Volgian, and is usually of sufficient magnitude to separate the Volgian from the Kimmeridgian. This is primarily determined from consideration of the palynofloral succession and the 4/76 10recognition of distinct break within it. In other instances this palynofloral break can be equated with change in lithofacies and/or palynofacies. By comparison with the palynofloral records of more complete well-dated onshore sections in northwest Europe (Gitmez 1970; Gitmez and Sarjeant 1972; Riley 1974; Riley and Sarjeant 1972), the palynofloral record within the Volgian of the North Sea appears to be consistently incomplete. Even in the more complete North Sea sections an assemblage appears to be missing which is developed within the interval spanning the P. elegans to P. hudlestoni zones in southern England and elsewhere. This assemblage is considered in North Sea unit connotation to be basal sub-assemblage of the H. pulchrum assemblage, I. e. the basal part of unit o. Evidence for the early Volgian age of this non-sequence is readily demonstrable in onshore sections in England and France which are well dated by independent means (figure 1). The non-sequence in Dorset is present within the Kimmeridge Clay sequence immediately below the White Band at the base of the P. pectinatus zone (see Cope et al. 1969 for details of the succession). It is indicated by marked palynofloral break in the dinoflagellate cyst populations (Riley 1974) by major changes in trace-element geochemistry of the sediments (Dunn 1972) and possibly by changes in the ostracode populations (Kilenyi 1969). These changes in Dorset appear to be correlatable with the important microfaunal change at the base of the Argile de Wimereux in the Boulonnais (Ager and Wallace 1966, p. 405). Further north, in the Kimmeridge Clay sequence at Marton clay pit in Yorkshire, Coccolith Limestone band is developed (Riley 1974) which appears to be equivalent to the Dorset White Band, and is probably of P. pectinatus zone age. Below the limestone is palynofloral break (Riley 1974) demonstrating the occurrence of similar non-sequence to that in Dorset. The absence of the P. hudlestoni zone beneath the limestone (Cope 1974) indicates that the succession at Marton is less complete than that in Dorset. The available data from onshore and certain offshore sections accordingly suggest that the magnitude of this non- sequence increases northwards from Dorset, through Yorkshire and into the North Sea basin. b) Middle Volgian This non-sequence is typically developed in the English Midlands where it is represented by the Upper Lydite Bed (Arkell 1933; Casey 1973). Casey (1973) interprets this bed as local expression of more widespread interval of inhibited deposition that widens northwards to embrace the basal beds of the Sandringham Sands and Spilsby Sandstone (eastern England) and eventually becomes incorporated in the much larger gap denoted by the Coprolite Bed at the base of the Speeton Clay in Yorkshire. The rotunda nodules of the Dorset Kimmeridge Clay succession (enclosure 64a, R.R.I. Onshore Jurassic report) and the Tour de Croi Nodule Bed of the Boulormais succession (enclosure 48a, same report) can be interpreted as the southernmost representatives of the Middle Volgian non-sequence/unconformity. 4/76 11This stratigraphic break may be developed within unit in the North Sea basin. It is, however, difficult to recognise and may only be indicated by subtle change in the palynofloral succession and/or palynofacies break. C) Late Volgian In certain North Sea wells, Cretaceous sediments rest unconformably on Jurassic sediments of late Volgian age. pronounced palynofacies break typically takes place at this level. The stratigraphic hiatus represented by this non-sequence can also be recognised in eastern England (Casey 1973) and is probably represented in Yorkshire by the large stratigraphic hiatus denoted by the Coprolite Bed at the base of the Speeton Clay (Casey 1971) and in Dorset by the quasi-marine incursion represented by the Cinder Bed (figure 1). 2.5 PA LYNOMORPHS AND THE RECOGNITION OF PALYNOFA CIES The term palynomorph includes all organic elements in palynological preparation. These comprise miospores, megaspores, dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, microforaminifera, algal cells, wood, tracheids, and cuticle. Dispersed primary organic elements such as these are collectively termed palynomorphs.. The distribution of palynomorphs in both recent and fossil sediments in relation to environments is duscussed by Cross et al. (1966), Stanley (1969), Williams and Sarjeant (1967), Davey (1971), Batten (1973) and Riley (1974), the last being primarily concerned with the Jurassic of western Europe. Palynomorph abundance, both relative and absolute, is recognised to be dependent on several factors, namely: 1. the number of palynomorphs originally available 2. the environment of deposition 3. the amount of post-depositional oxidation and destruction 4. the nature of the processing techniques used to isolate the palynomorphs A number of photographs (Enclosure 5b) are enclosed to give an example of various palynological facies types. These have been taken from samples collected from the regressive Kimmeridgian-Portlandian succession in Dorset, England. Photographs 1-4 are from the Portland and Purbeck Beds and 5-8 from the Kimmeridge Clay. Standard palynological techniques were used to isolate the organic acid resistant fraction of each of the samples; the oxidation techniques which considerably modify the organic material both quantitatively and qualitatively, have been excluded. Some of the dispersed organic material comprises sapropelic organic mush and reworked palynomorphs. Accumulated organic matter in the form of bituminous substances (kerogens) is an important constituent of some of the preparations examined, particularly those from the late Jurassic and less frequently in the Liassic. The distribution of organic elements in terrestrial to marine environments is summarised in Enclosures 5a and 5b. Certain aspects are discussed in greater detail here. 6/77 12Fern spores are taken to have been distributed primarily by water. The fern spore assemblage is progressively modified by reduction in diversity and grain size with increasing distance from source (D1, D2, D3, etc.). Bisaccate pollen shows an irregular distribution and this taken to be due to variable but generally prolonged flotation in water. Classopollis may represent plant growing in coastal sites (Hughes and Moody-Stuart, 1967). There are some qualitative indications in the coarser sediment samples of relative proximity to the land mass, namely: 1. Presence of extreme size variants of miospores 2. Presence of spore masses and tetrads 3. Presence of exotic specimens with strongly developed or extreme characters 4. Presence of megaspores (or fragments) which presumably mostly originated in interfluvial standing-water areas. Away from the landmass there is seawards decrease in absolute miospore abundance associated with decrease in diversity, function of increasing distance from the miospore source. There is also decrease in size and abundance of wood and other plant debris (Photographs 1-8, Enclosure 56). Dinoflagellate cysts show seaward increase in both absolute abundance and diversity; they also become more elaborately ornamentated. This is taken to reflect the generally unstable conditions that prevail in an inshore environment; probably more specifically changes in salinity and water turbulence. Cysts with elaborate ornamentation are considered to be oceanic or open-sea forms (Reid 1972). Their processes and structures are considered to be buoyancy controls which increase the flotation properties of the cyst in low-energy open-sea environments. There is decrease seawards in the ratio of peridineacean to gonyaulacacean dinoflagellate cysts. The maximum value for this ratio is nowhere, in the sediments investigated, considered to be higher than 10. This, by analogy with published data (see Harland, 1973), implies that no true oceanic/deep-sea sediments are developed in the Northwest European Jurassic. Acanthomorph arcitarchs (i.e. Micrhysteridium and Solisphaeridium and morphologically similar forms) are rare to absent in open-marine sediments, but attain considerable importance in inshore, shallow water environments where they constitute up to 90% of the planktonic microflora. Short-spined forms dominate the high-energy, and large-spined forms dominate the low-energy, inshore, shallow water environments. This distribution pattern was first noted by Wall (1965) in his study of Lower Jurassic assemblages from England. With prolonged transport and reworking of wood and cuticle material there is an increase in degradation and loss of structure (Davey, 1971). Sapropelic and bituminous organic (kerogen) substances in pa13-nomorph assemblages imply stagnant anaerobic bottom conditions and are particularly abundant in the late Jurassic and some of the Liassic preparations. The late Jurassic bituminous substances have 6/77 137:71 g:73 high bromine and iodine content which suggests that plants are prime contributor to their formation. It appears probable (Riley, 1974) that the bituminous substances were formed by degradation of plant debris in coastal swamps and lagoons, subsequently transported into the marine environment and preserved in anaerobic conditions. Micrinite is probably the product of the degradation of plant cellulose, the more volatile plant substances being converted to kerogen, and is locally abundant in inshore environments. The overall palynological characters of the bituminous sediments indicate that the sediments were preserved in depressions developed on an extensive epicontinental sea shelf. Stratigraphic correlation by the range and/or abundance of any particular taxon clearly has limitations unless the value of the observations in each case has been related to the palynological fades. There is no real justification, however, in putting limits to the open marine environments, as indicated solely by microplankton. This may indicate period of time when landmass was distant from the depositional site, or period when conditions (e.g. nutrient supply) were at an optimum for microplankton productivity. When dealing with vertical sequences, whether field exposures or in wells, evaluation of the total palynological data, particularly trends in diversity of taxa and the relative abundance of miospores/microplankton can be valuable tool for indicating, with considerable precision, periods of marine transgression and regression. decrease in cyst diversity (species) through vertical sequence is, for example, typically indicative of the approach of near-shore sedimentation. G/'773. PA LA EOGEOGB PITY The geological history and palaeogeography of the northern North Sea are discussed in the light of all the compiled data available for this study. These data are displayed by stratigraphic sections and sketch facies maps (figures to 4) compiled from the stratigraphic and core description charts in volume 3. No seismic or structural data were available for use in compiling the maps. 3.1 ENVIRONMENTS OF DEPOSITION The classification of environments of clepos,ition at the present day is not easy (see Crosby 1972, for example) and their recognition and definition in the Jurassic is thus even more difficult. Environments of deposition are recognised by comparison of the biofacies and lithofacies with present-day counterparts and, because fossils are good indicators, the further one goes back in geological time the more difficult the comparison becomes. Moreover, the different groups of fossils may indicate different environmental conditions - for example foraminifera have been used to give an indication of depth of water, while miospores and microplankton indicate rather the proximity of shoreline (see Palynofacies Section). When reporting environments of deposition in wells it is the custom of BEI to use the classification defined by IIedgpeth (1957), and this subdivision is used on the stratigraphic charts. Hedgpeth divides the sublittoral into inner and outer at depth of 60 metres (200 feet): since it is quite unrealistic to consider trying to split Jurassic faunas on the basis of this criterion, the terms inner sublittoral and outer sublittoral are used here solely to indicate shallow marine conditions and deeper marine conditions, without being specific about what depth of water is meant. The term continental as used on the charts in volume includes sediments laid down in fresh water. The Middle Brent Sand in the northern Viking graben (labelled sand Unit on the charts in Volume 3) is considered to represent low energy delta-top fades, where Hedgpeth's littoral zone is inapplicable. Within this unit in the northern Viking graben (U. K. Blocks 2, 3, 210, 211: Norway block 33) we use the column brackish/lagoonal/deltaic on the stratigraphic charts to represent delta-top fades with no definite marine influence and the column littoral to represent delta-top fades (saline interdistributary bays). Inner sublittoral implies fully marine conditions. The Jurassic sediments of northwest Europe were deposited in many different environments. keynote for understanding the depositional environments, certainly in the Middle Jurassic and probably also in other parts of the North Sea Jurassic, is the realisation that all the deposits were laid down very close to sea level. The extremely widespread shallow epeiric seas which are deduced to have been present in northwest Europe have no real present-day counterparts. Most of the rocks are of shallow-water marine origin, but there are many rocks of transitional (e.g. deltaic, estuarine, beach) origin and others of continental origin. When we contrast shallow marine and deltaic deposition, the difference in palaeogeography may have been ten feet or less, so that marked thickness contrasts are attributable to differential subsidence. 6/77to  The wells available for this study tend to be single well on structure and thus there is no way of knowing whether or not they are typical of facies conditions in the areas between structures. The whole northern North Sea area is first discussed below, and later (in section 3.3) details of the northern Viking graben are described. In the northern Viking graben, we employ the Middle Jurassic Brent Sand terminology of Bowen (1975), and owing to the greater well control compared to other areas it is possible to go into much more detail here (see stratigraphic subdivisions enclosures 39to 45),In order to save space, the subdivision of the Brent Sand Formation are abbreviated on the stratigraphic charts in volume 3. ......1 The Upper Brent Sand is shown as sand Unit 1, the Middle Brent Sand as sand Unit 2, and the Lower Brent Sand as sand Unit 3.1.3 BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC UNITS I. UNITS Twelve units are defined within the Jurassic interval of the North Sea. The wilts are designated by the letters to z. In certain instances subunits are recognised. The units and subunits are based on qualitative and quantitative evaluation of microfloral and microfaunal criteria and are considered to be more or less isochronous. Units essentially based on the vertical distribution of dinoflagellate cysts have been recognised. These could well be considered as biozones (1972 Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification p. 307). They are, however, not the complete answer to problems of zonation, and must be considered as tool to be used in conjunction with other fossil groups. The use of benthonic foraminifera in association with microplankton is of particular value for the recognition of certain subunits. The units are considered to be in part Acme and/or Concurrent Range-Zones. Age connotations assigned to the units are based on both published and confidential reports, selected bibliography of which is given. I. ASSE MBLAGE The microfaunal subdivision of the Jurassic, as established in this project, is .based primarily upon the association or assemblages of foraminifera rather than index forms. In large part of the section this has meant the identification of changes in the agglutinating element of the microfauna which often constitutes the entire assemblage in many parts of the succession. Ostracodes generally occur too infrequently to be of real value for correlation purposes but locally can be of 3ome stratigraphical and environmental significance. In order to give greater meaning to the stratigraphic distribution of the ostracodes certain groupings, termed faunules, have been made. These faunules are: Galliaecytheridea/Mandelstamia Galliaecytherid?a Eucytherura/Pleurocythere Darwinula Macrodentina bathonica Lophocythere Procytheridea Hungarella Healdia/Hungarella and have been commented upon in the description of the relevant units (T.3.4). Pour palynofloral assemblages are recognised within Lower and Middle I (4)Jurassic (Bajocian - Bathonian) palynofloras viz. Nannoceratopsis gracilis, Tsugaepollenites, Klukisporites,and Cerebropollenites cf. thiergartii - Ricciisporites cf. tuberculatus - Cyclogranisporites type (R). These assemblages reflect: a. the overall range of in situ and ?caved (?*) N. gracilis within each well studied. - b. the distribution of Tsugaepollenites group within Middle Jurassic miospore assemblages and its deeper occurrence both in situ and ?caved (?*) within Lower Jurassic palynofloras. (The relative absence of Tsugaepollenites within Lower Jurassic palynofloras is of significance locally in unit delineation). c. the range of occurrence of Klukisporites locally within impoverished palynofloral assemblages. This is of significance to local correlations. d. the general incoming down-hole and overall distribution of type palynomorohs within Lower Jurassic palynofloras. This assemblage is critical, when related to the N. gracilis assemblage, to unit delineation within the Lower Jurassic. I. 3. 3. EVENTS A number of palynofloral events are recognised. In the Upper Jurassic these are based on localised abundancies of particular taxa developed over short vertical interval and as such may reflect local facies control. In the Middle and Lower Jurassic they are based solely on visual quantitative analysis of palynomorph content within sample (see Enclosure 4). Each event indicates the presence of particular species or taxonomic grouping (complex/group) within sample in varying degrees of relative abundance (i.e. relative to their occurrence in adjacent samples of well). The abundance of a particular event is recorded in terms of relative commonness: wells with impoverished or virtually barren palynofloral contents may be considered to have palynomorph events solely on the presence of particular taxon. A limited number of microfaunal events have been recognised in addition to the assemblages. These events are more geographically restricted than the assemblages and are therefore of more local stratigraphic value. micropalaeontological event has been established where significant numbers of an organism occur regularly over part of the section covered by particular assemblage. Alternatively the more consistent occurrence, regardless of numbers, of an individual species or group of fossils over particular section or region may also constitute an event. I. 3. 4. DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL UNITS Since the major part of the material examined consists of ditch cuttings samples, the boundary lines between the units are not always sharp. To I (5)certain extent the boundaries are subjective and there may be some overlap of species. The ranges of selected taxa characterising the units are shown on Enclosure 3. Unit boundaries are drawn between samples except where the boundary occurs within composite ditch cuttings sample when it is generally taken at the median point. I) Unit (Late Volgian) Recognition and age equivalence of this unit is based solely on the occurrence of the I. villosum biozone. The ease of recognition of this biozone is determined by the environmental parameters that prevailed during deposition of the containing sediment. Where conditions were optimum for microplankton productivity the biozone is readily recognisable being characterised by rich and diverse microflora containing the index species in varying degrees of abundance. Under conditions of shallow-water, relatively higher energy deposition, the microflora is considerably reduced, both in terms of numbers and diversity. Pterospermopsis aureolata and Leiosphaerids are generally the dominant elements under such conditions and may frequently be associated with microforaminifera and acanthomorph acritarchs. In the absence of more age restricted taxa, differentiation from the upper limits of the older Hystrichodinium pulchrum assemblage (unit o) may be difficult. Accordingly the presence of the unit may not have been recognised in certain areas and in these instances all of the Volgian may be given the unit connotation o. Where the containing sediments accumulated under low energy anaerobic bottom conditions, bituminous and degraded sapropelic debris is the dominant kerogen. Meroplankton recovery may then be low due to the masking/diluting effect of the organic debris, accordingly delimitation of this unit from underlying units may be very difficult. In extreme cases, where bituminous/ sapropelic rich sediments range throughout the Upper Jurassic and palynomorph recovery was poor throughout, only broad unit connotations can be given and no boundaries can be indicated with confidence. The age of unit is considered to be late Volgian by comparison with the occurrence of the key-species in well dated (by independent means) onshore sections in eastern England (Riley 1974) and the Russian platform (Vozzhennikova 1967). A number of the key forms which characterise this unit in the North Sea (i.e. Imbatodinium villosurn, Scriniodinium magnificum, Tubotuberella rhombiformis and Acanthaulax sp. A) are apparently restricted to the Boreal realm, although they do range into the Neocomian in certain areas. Moving southwards towards the Tethyan realm (i.e. In southern England and northern France) the unit palynoflora becomes far less diverse and is characterised by species such as Dichadogonyaulax culmula and Belodinium dysculum. I (6)The lower part of unit is usually marked by the incoming of the Haplophragmoides cf. volgensis foraminiferal assemblage. In the southern part of the Norwegian area this microfaunal assemblage extends to the top of unit n, becomes highly diversified and can be subdivided. Although continuing to be dominated by agglutinated foraminifera, calcareous benthonic forms may attain some considerable numerical importance within its upper limits. Superficially these assemblages are similar to those recovered from the marine Callovian in the north-central regions of the North Sea. Ostracodes (the Mandelstamia/Galliaecytheridea faunule) usually absent elsewhere in the North Sea, may be associated with this lateral development of the H. cf. volgensis assemblage. The dominant species of the ostracode faunule include Galliaecytheridea spinosa, G. wolburgi and Mandelstamia tumida. ii) Unit (Volgian) The limits of this unit are defined by the recognition of the llystrichodiniwn pulchrum biozone, into the upper part of which extends the II. cf. volgensis foraminiferal assemblage. The H. pulchrum biozone persists down to about the level of the elegans (ex gravesia) ammonite zone; as such its lower limit occurs in close proximity to the Volgian - Kimmeridgian boundary as defined in boreal stratigraphic nomenclature. The time-interval over which this assemblage occurs was one of considerable dinoflagellate evolution and expansion. Synthesis of the available data from well-dated onshore sections (Gitmez & Sarjeant 1972; Riley & Sarjeant 1972; Riley 1974) demonstrates that number of sub-assemblages can be recognised. Unfortunately recognition of these sub-assemblages is based upon evolutionary first appearances and as such they are very difficult to define when working with cuttings. The uppermost sub-assemblage (Muderongia simplex) is characterised by the co-occurrence of M. simplex, Fibraeosphaeridium insignitum, Gonyaulacysta longicornis, several new species of Gonyaulacysta, Pterospermopsis aureolata and Imbatodinium mutabilis in association with rare to infrequent records of Classopollis echinatus and Cicatricosisporites spp. The lower limit of this assemblage is considered to be within the rotunda - pallasioides zones. second sub-assemblages ranges down into the upper part of the hudlestoni zone. This is characterised by the absence of number of species which occur in the M. simplex sub-assemblage (i.e. M. simplex, F. insignitum, C. echinatus and Cicatricosisporites spp.), the evolutionary first appearance of certain key species (i.e. Dichadogonyaulax panneum and Lanterna spp.) and rise in abundance of H. pulchrum. The oldest sub-assemblage ranges down to the elegans zone; it is characterised by the effective evolutionary first appearance of Gonyaulacysta longicornis, 0112-,osphaeridium pulcherrimum, H. pulchrum and associated taxa. Recognition of these sub-assemblages is rendered difficult and in many instances it is impossible to delimit or even recognise them due to problems of caving when dealing with evolutionary first appearances. Furthermore the late Jurassic palynofloral record is often fragmentary due to the effects of Kimmerian earthmovements and associated non-sequences which have cut out parts of the succession. I (7)predominate over the calcareous benthonic forms which normally characterise this unit. In addition ostracodes representative of the Eucytherura/Pleurocythere faunule occur: this faunule is of very limited geographical extent and consists of rare specimens of E. costae-irregularis, P. cf. borealis and P. arcuata. v) Unit (early Oxfordian) This unit is characterised by the limits of the Wanaea (W. fimbriata) assemblage biozone. Foraminifera still belong to the L. muensteri assemblage which contains significant number of calcareous benthonic forms. The age of this unit is considered to be early Oxfordian (mariae - cordatum zones) by analogy with the occurrence in well-dated onshore sections of the key species (Riley & Sarjeant 1972). vi) Unit (Callovian) Two divisions of this unit (the Ctenidodinium assemblage) can be recognised. The upper subunit s1, the age of whi.ch is considered to be late Callovian, is defined on palynological criteria at the base of the Wanaea unit which may approximately coincide with the incoming down well of common Chytroeisphaeridia sp. and Ctenidodinium spp. Criteria for recognising the top of this unit do, however, include the absence of species such as W. fimbriata and Polystephanephorus calathus. Within the sl subunit localised acme of G. jurassica appears to be of some stratigraphic value; comparable acme occurs in equivalent age strata in parts of onshore England and France. Species of Wanaea (excluding W. fimbriata) may also be present, often in numerical significance. The top of the s2 subunit is defined on the incoming of the Haplophragmoides canui foraminiferal assemblage. vii) Unit (early Callovian - late Bathonian) The top of this unit is defined by the incoming of the Pareodinia - Meiourogonyaulax assemblage, which is characterised by the relative abundance of species of Pareodinia and Meiourogonyaulax and decrease in importance of species of Ctenidodinium, Gonyaulacysta and Scriniodinium. Deeper in the interval assigned to this unit there is progressive decrease in diversity of microplankton species. Valensiella and indeterminate species of Chytroeisphaertdia may attain some numerical significance and there may be local acmes of the genus Pareodinia. The age of this unit is considered to be early Callovian - late Bathonian. Amongst the records documented in literature, the German late Bathonian assemblages described by Gocht (1970) appear to be the most comparable, although in Germany species of CtenHodinium and Gonyaulacysta appear to be numerically more important than in the North Sea. In certain North Sea wells the later Bathonian is characterised by an abundance of species of Pareodinia including P. ceratophora vars. and P. tripartitus with species of Meiourogonyaulax, Chytroeisphaeridia and Valensiella being of minor significance. 4/76 (9)Unit is divided into subunits t1 and t2. Within subunit ti, recognition of late Bathonian restricted dinoflagellate assemblage is occasionally feasible, allowing identification of the Callovian-Bathonian boundary. The incoming of subunit t2 is based on the appearance of the Ammobaculites coprolithiformis foraminiferal assemblage, generally in the marine argillaceous shales directly overlying the Middle Jurassic sands of the northern Viking Graben. In many instances it is not possible to separate the A. coprolithiformis microfauna from the overlying H. canui foraminiferal assemblage. These two assemblages together often form the most prominent foraminiferal feature in the Jurassic in the Viking Graben. The Middle Jurassic sands in the northern Viking Graben are difficult to rationalise in terms of biostratigraphic units because of lateral marine to non-marine (deltaic) lithofacies changes, particularly within sand Unit (the Middle Brent Sand Member). These influence the presence and absence of the marine dinoflagellates, on which the Bathonian stage has been subdivided. A unit/subunit subdivision has consequently been developed for the Bathonian using dual system of marine designated units (t and v) based essentially on dinoflagellate criteria, and non-marine subunits (ul u3) based on miospore criteria. viii) Unit (Bathonian non-marine facies) The local miospore influxes which define non-marine subunits ul, u2 and u3 are traceable laterally from well to well and are clearly related in their occurrence to the development of sand units and (Upper and Middle Brent Sand Member). They are accordingly considered to be good non-marine local correlation indices in the absence of diagnostic marine organisms. Subunit ul When present, subunit ul represents palynofloral assemblage developed between the top of the Middle Jurassic sands and the underlying comparatively well delineated unit u2. It embraces subdued palynoflora generally of type with P. elatoides, Lycopodiumsporites spp., C. mesozoicus and Tsugaepollenites spp. being most markedly common. 5 type palynofloras may occasionally be developed. Subunit u2 The ul - u2 boundary is delimited generally by sudden influx of numerous Deltoidospora spp. - Granulatisporites subgranulosus associated with varying relative abundances of Duplexisporites problematicus, Neoraistrickia spp., Sestrosporites pseudoalveolatus - Foveosporites/ - Foveotriletes types and Staplinisporites caminus - Densoisporites velatus complexes. Without this influx it is at times difficult to separate subunits ul and u2. 4/76 I (10)Lio Tat72774 APPENDIX II P ETROGRAPHY IE. METHODS Petrographic studies of Jurassic sandstones in the North Sea have been carried out for two purposes: to determine environments of deposition of the reservoir sands, and to record diagenetic processes which have affected reservoir quality. The studies have been confined to well sections with conventional core, which yield much more data than non-cored intervals. The environmental results, however, have been extrapolated to non-cored intervals and non-cored wells. Every core of Jurassic or possible Jurassic age has been examined in detail; core description charts on scale of 1:100 show log of lithology and grain size, and a graphic representation of all sedimentary structures of both organic and physical origin. Samples have been selected from representative sandstone lithologies for thin section examination, photographs of some of which are included in volume 2. The results of petrographic analysis of samples are plotted on the core description charts. The results of these studies have been used to infer depositional environmaits, and to assess diagenetic effects. 11.2 GENERAL PE IROGRAPTIIC FEATURES Detrital grains are represented on core description charts by their major mineral groupings (i.e. quartz, feldspar, mica and rock fragments), but in the well reports further detail of mineralogy is given including the relative abundances of various grains (by order of listing). In all the sandstones studied quartz is the most abundant detrital grain present and is commonly of the simple strained variety. Strained, as opposed to unstrained quartz, is recognised by the presence of undulose or wavy extinction when observed in thin section between crossed nicols. As its name implies, this phenomenon is due to straining caused principally by tectonic stresses associated with both metamorphism and igneous intrusions. The presence of abundant strained quartz therefore implies that the source area for the sandstones possibly included metamorphic terrain and/or an intrusive igneous province. This source is further evidenced by the presence of occasional metamorphic quartzite detrital grains which, generally, are recognised by the very elongate streaky nature of the component quartz grains. The clay content of sandstone samples, recognised in thin section, is shown undivided on the core description charts, although in some cases it is possible to recognise individual clays. Detrital clay is normally extensively composed of illite/ sericite, but it is poorly crystalline, and the clay minerals cannot be determined with an optical microscope. Authigenic clay, crystallised in the pore space of sandstonessubsequent to deposition and probably before deep burial, is normally much better crystalline, so that individual clay minerals can be recognised. An estimate of the relative importance of detrital clay, authigenic illite and authigenic kaolinite is given in the text describing each well. Some kaolinite commonly forms as an alteration product of musccvite. In this case, it usually occupies similar space to the original mica, and thus has much less effect on porosity and permeability than clays in the pore space. Mineral cements, crystallised in the pore space in the sandstones, include carbonate crystals, and quartz and feldspar rims which have enlarged the detrital grains. As thin sections have not been stained, the carbonate minerals are not normally distinguished, though occasionally calcite, dolomite and siderite can be recognised on textural criteria. In such cases the type of cement is described in the appropriate well data sheet (Appendix IV). When calcite or dolomite occurs in any great abundance it commonly forms corrosive poikilitic crystals. These are large crystals which completely enclose number of detrital grains and have replaced much of the original material. Replace- ment can be recognised in thin section by very angular and irregular detrttal grain boundaries. Quartz and feldspar cements occur, often in the same sandstone, as over- growths around respective detrital grains. The overgrowths are predominantly anhedral (poor crystal development) and usually very thin. The feldspar overgrowths are potash feldspar occurring around microcline and orthoclase feldspar (potash feldspar) grains. The severity of pressure solution is estimated from types of grain contacts and throughout most wells it is of moderate intensity. However, in some wells slightly sutured grain contacts have been recorded indicating moderate to severe pressure solution. In these instances pressure solution is often an important factor reducing primary depositional porosity, and is reported in the porosity notes in individual well data sheets (Appendix IV). Pressure solution is commonly considered to be depth-, i.e. pressure-related. Our experience of the North Sea, however, shows lack of depth-correlation, so that depth of burial cannot be the sole determining factor. Aspects of the geochemistry of pore fluids also have bearing on silica solubility, notably pH (Krauskopf, 1959). High pH values promote the dissolution of quartz, and it has been suggested (Thomson, 1959) that CO2-rich waters attacking illite can result in raised pH. Alteration features encountered in sandstone samples examined in thin section are generally rare. However, the features which have been noted include the partial or complete sericitisation and kaolinisation of feldspar, kaolinisation of muscovite and, very rarely, possible recrystallisation of detrital clay. 3 DETERMINATION OF ENVIRONMENTS Interpretations have been made of the environments of deposition of the beds in the cores. These are based not only on the sedimentological and petrographic data shown on the core description charts, but also on all available micropalaeontological and palynological data obtained from core samples (usually shales and silty beds). The environmental interpretations are given in the text describing each well, and very brief descriptions are shown alongside the cores on the stratigTaphic sections. 11 (2)m  The environmental interpretations are based on very wide range of both published and unpublished data and experience, and it is impossible to give complete list of references. few of the most useful recent works are Morgan (1970), Rigby and Hamblin (1972), Pettijohn et al. (1972), and Reineck and Singh (1973). Additional papers of particular relevance to Jurassic trace fossils are Farrow (1966), and Ager and Wallace (1970). In the brief descriptions on the stratigraphic sections, some of the terms used to describe deltaic facies need explanation. Delta plain implies delta-top situation, away from distributary channels, and cut off from the sea, so that the water is fresh. Lagoon to interdistributary bay is used to infer similar situation with very limited amount of marine influence, while beds described as interdistributary bay have appreciable marine influence with dinoflagellates and occasionally foraminifera. All of the three facies described above are cut by sand bodies which in different cases appear to represent tidal or distributary channels, distributary mouth bars, or crevasse splay deposits (these are formed where distributary breaks through its bounding levee and deposits thin layer of sand into the nearby interdistributary areas). Although we recognise depositional processes and environments in terms of familiar deltaic models, there is one important feature in which the North Sea differs from most published models. The major present day deltas of the world are mainly developing on the margins of deep basins, often on continental margins. Considerable subsidence takes place, deposition is rapid and great thicknesses of sediment are built up. By contrast, the North Sea was shallow basin (probably with water depths of only a few tens of feet), undergoing much slower subsidence. Net deposition was probably therefore much less and consequently, although the deltaic facies covers wide area, it is usually of no great thickness, and individual beds cannot be traced between exploration wells over the area. In the lower part (Unit 3) of the Middle Jurassic sands of the northern North Sea, an interval is commonly shown on the stratigraphic charts with an inner sublittoral environment, although few if any marine faunas or floras have been recovered from it. This is because the environmental categories of Hedg-peth (1957), which are used on the charts, are insufficiently flexible to do justice to all of the North Sea environments. In the case of the example cited above, it is considered that the beds were laid down in inner sublittoral depths, but under conditions of restricted salinity. 11.4 MAGENESIS Examination of the distribution of the four main authigenic minerals (quartz, feldspar, carbonate and authigenic clays) reveals regional patterns for each of the minerals in the northern North Sea area. Wells south of the block (U. K. sector) are too widely scattered for regional patterns to be deduced. This discussion on regional trends of authigenic minerals is therefore confined to the northern North Sea area (Viking graben), but details of diagenesis in cored wells from further south can be obtained from the well data sheets (appendix IV). It is re-emphasised that data have been drawn only from cored intervals, and this restriction means that it is impossible to provide meaningful separate analyses of the different 11 (3)sandstone units in the Jurassic. The following remarks therefore apply to Jurassic sands in general, although most of the data come from parts of the Middle Jurassic. This somewhat unsystematic sampling procedure must be borne in mind when assessing the conclusions discussed below, together with the fact that these conclusions are based on only twelve cored welts. The distribution of each of the main minerals is outlined as follows: II. 4.1. QUARTZ Quartz cement, in the form of syntaxial overgrowths, exhibits distribution suggesting north-south orientated belts. The abundance and size of overgrowths is greatest in central belt (211/11-1 to 3/8-2) and decreases both eastwards and westwards. The least silica cementation of all is seen in 33/9-1. II. 4. 2. FELDSPAR Feldspar cement, occurring as normally syntaxial overgrowths similar in habit to quartz overgrowths is most abundant in the area around 211/24-2 and 33/12-1. Lesser amounts are present over the rest of the northern Viking graben, although feldspar cementation becomes negligible in the north-west. II. 4. 3. CARBONATE The presence of local concretionary sandstones (tightly cemented by abundant poikilitic carbonate) has not been considered in estimating the degree of carbonate diagenesis, as isolated concretions occur throughout the northern North Sea area. Carbonate cement, normally occurring as moderate sized (about 250 microns), occasionally corrosive, pore filling crystals, has distribution resembling that of feldspar cement, although in addition, carbonate is almost absent in Statfjord and further south in the block. II. 4. 4. AUTHIGENIC CLAYS Authigenic clays include both kaolinite and illite, though kaolinite is always more common than illite. Kaolinite occurs as aggregates of pore-filling crystals with 'book'-like form, whereas illite, in the form of flaky crystals, is normally intermixed with detrital clay or authigenic kaolinite. Illite very rarely forms thin rims around detrital grains. The distribution of authigenic clays has markedly different pattern from any of the cements described above. north-east to south- west belt containing moderate to severe clay cementation exists stretching from 211/24-2 to 2/5-1 within the Viking graben. Lesser amounts of authigenic clays are found in wells to the south-east and to the north-west, and the minimum amounts are, as in the case of carbonate cement, in Statfjord and in the block. II. 4. 5. SIGNIFICANCE OF PATTERNS The relative effect of the four different cementing materials on porosity and permeability is different. Carbonate has the smallest effect on both porosity and permeability, although the isolated crystals decrease porosity in proportion to their II (4)abundance. Quartz, and to lesser extent feldspar, has the effect of enlarging detrital grains, so that reductions in porosity and permeability are approximately in proportion, although sealing of smaller pore throats may further reduce permeability. Clays have the most adverse effect on permeability, because their numerous very small crystals greatly divide the intergranular pore space into much smaller individual pore spaces. Taking into consideration the distribution of clay and quartz cements, the overall picture suggests that minimum diagenesis is likely to be encountered in the eastern parts of the 211 and blocks (U. K. sector) and in the adjacent Norwegian sector. Carbonate and feldspar cementation become negligible to the south and east, and so the minimum overall cementation in the area covered by the twelve cored wells appears to be found in the Statfjord.area and in the block (U. K. ). It should be noted that none of the authigenic minerals has distribution closely parallelling that of the depositional environments (described in Chapter of the main report). One aspect of this, which is not yet fully understood, and which can only be touched upon in this essentially reconnaissance study, is the geochemical evidence provided by the authigenic Tinerals. The presence of potash feldspar cement indicates relatively high content in pore fluids, and hence probably high values of pH. Authigenic feldspar, although normally quantitatively insignificant, may thus be an indicator of high pH conditions likely to promote the dissolution of silica and perhaps the precipitation of carbonate minerals. This appears to be generally confirmed by the correspondence of areas of maximum feldspar and carbonate cementation, but is less clear for the relationship of authigenic quartz. II (5)WELL NO.: 15/6-3 (NORWAY) Operator: Esso Interval Studied 11060' to 11860' BIOSTRATIGRAPHY Upper - Middle (Bathonian) Jurassic The Cretaceous - Jurassic boundary is well defined on palynological criteria; palynofacies change at 11160' associated with the incoming of Jurassic palynoflora. Palynomorph recovery was not very good due to the nature of the samples, but elements of the G. cladophora assemblage of subunit pl equivalence were recovered. Two questionable occurrence of P. aureolata and single specimen of Leiosphere were ncted. This may tentatively suggest that some Volgian is present, perhaps thin interval. A palynofacies change takes place at +11400' which is associated with the incoming of thin development of the H. canui foraminiferal assemblage. This is taken to be indicative of the Callovian- Bathonian of unit s2 t2 equivalence. very poor development of the Radiolaria/Rhaxella assemblage occurs above 11400' and in association with the palynofacies types developed unit connotation of late Oxfordian - Kimmeridgian age is applied down to 11400' where non- sequence is proposed. A further non-sequence is suggested at 11440' on lithological criteria. The interval 11440' - 11630' yielded very impoverished palynofloral and microfaunal assemblages. Middle Jurassic An influx of P. ceratophora in association with certain other palynofloral elements suggests Bathonian age (t) for the core interval 11630' - 11692.5'. The cored interval 11718.5' - 11754' is dominated by inertinite-vitrinite rich palynofloras of aspect. These are considered to be of unit equivalence and are somewhat lacking in microplankton content. Palynological samples examined from the cored intervals 11693' - 11718.5' and 11755' - 11758' proved to be virtually barren. No age diagnostic palynomorphs were recorded from these intervals. IV 15/6-3 (1)The upper contact of the interval of undated fluvial sandstone (11693' to 11718.5') in the core between two intervals of Bathonian (t(u)) shale is strongly angular unconformity, but the lower contact is not seen. The fluvial sandstone may be either an intercalation within the Bathonian, or repetition by faulting of the underlying beds, since similar fluvial sandstones reappear. below fault at 11758'. The intercalation hypothesis is favoured by (1) the rarity of reverse faulting in the essentially tensional North Sea area, and (2) the fact that the overlying Bathonian sequence is not repetition of the underlying Bathonian. However, it is unlikely that strongly angular erosion surface (at 11693') was able to develop within Bathonian time. ?Lower Jurassic The interval 11758' - 11860' is fluvial facies consisting of greenish white, locally coarse, sandstones with traces of green shale which are shown by core data to be mudflakes. No microfauna or Microflora have been recovered, and the age of ?Lower. Jurassic is assigned on regional palaeogeographic grounds (see section of main text). PE TROGIZA PH Lithology Yellow-brown and locally white sandstone containing slightly stylolitised argillaceous laminae in the lower part of the interval, rare mudflake horizons, and scattered pebbles in the upper part of the interval. Carbonate veins occur around 11568'. Petrography Detrital grains: Simple, mostly strained quartz with lesser feldspar (plagioclase, microcline and orthoclase) and muscovite, and locally rare to trace amounts of rock fragments (mudflakes and very rare metamorphic quartzite) and zircon. Clays: Mainly authigenic kaolinite locally with some detrital clay. Cements: Carbonate rare to locally abundant; thin quartz and, locally, potash feldspar overgrowths. IV 15/6-3 (2)I Porosity: Fair to poor or absent; primary depositional porosity was probably quite good in places but much reduced by authigenic clay and pressure solution effects and, locally, totally destroyed by carbonate cement. Environment of Deposition Moderate energy; diagnostic sedimentary structures are lacking, but the general imperssion gained is of shallow, inshore, marine sands. Marine conditions are confirmed by belemnite at 11576'. Yellow-brown sandstones with occasional pebble horizons, and sulphurous shale laminae in the upper part of the interval. Clay lined burrows are fairly common and wood debris is important below 11658'. Detrital grains: Mostly simple strained quartz with subordinate feldspar (mostly plagioclase and microcline), rare composite quartz and muscovite and trace amounts of metamorphic quartzite rock fragments and possible altered rutile. Plant material occurs at 11630'. Clays: Mostly pore-filling authigenic kaolinite with very sparse detrital clay. At 11630' detrital clay is more common. Cements: Rare; quartz as thin anhedral (rarely subhedral) overgrowths and very minor amounts of carbonate occurring as small isolated crystals. Porosity: Fair to good; primary depositional porosity probably quite good significantly reduced by the growth of authigenic kaolinite and pressure solution effects (grain contacts are often slightly sutured). Moderate to high energy; marine conditions evidenced by abundant burrows and bioturbation; clay drapes suggest tidal influence. shallow marine environment close to terrestrial source is indicated by the palynofloras. Probably similar shallow, inshore, marine sands to the overlying interval, with rapid deposition of shifting sand indicated by the common clay linings of the burrows. The base of the interval represents marine transgression over the underlying non-marine beds. IV 15/6-3 (3)Coal with seatearth, overlying interbedded pale grey, waxy shales and white sandstones. The base of the interval is formed by an angular unconformity; the lowest shale contains angular fragments of the underlying beds. One thin section examined from silty shale proves to be rich in sphaeresiderite, contained in detrital clay matrix (see Plate). Low to moderate energy; sphaerosiderite, shale colouration, plant roots and coal all suggest non-marine conditions, which-are confirmed by palynofloras of the Deltoidospora (coal swamp) facies. Finely laminated white to light brown argillaceous sandstones containing common mudflake horizons. Bedding dips at 45. The top of the interval is an angular unconformity. Detrital grains: Simple mostly strained quartz with fairly rare feldspar (mainly plagioclase and microcline), muscovite and mudflakes and trace amounts of composite quartz and zircon. Mudflakes appear to have been partially replaced by siderite. Clays: Mostly detrital clay with some authigenic kaolinite and Mite. Cements: Quartz as thin anhedral overgrowths and small irregular siderite concretions. Porosity: Poor; primary porosity probably fair and has been mostly reduced by cementation and pressure solution effects. Moderate energy; although diagnostic structures are lacking, these cross-bedded sands with current ripples and numerous mudflakes suggest fluvial environment. IV 15/6-3 (4) Ii p. Mainly light grey silts and shales with plant fragments; light grey sandstones also present. The base of this interval is formed by fault. The top was not available for examination, but may also be faulted. r. Detrital grains: Simple strained quartz with fairly rare feldspar (mainly plagioclase and microcline), simple unstrained quartz and, locally, muscovite. Trace amounts of composite quartz and zircon also occur. Clays: At 11728' mostly authigenic kaolinite with some detrital clay, though at 11758' largely detrital clay with additional rock flour (probably as result of faulting). Cements: At 11728' quartz as thin anhedral overgrowths and at 11758' common carbonate (probably both calcite and siderite). Porosity: Poor to absent; primary porosity probably fair and has been much reduced or destroyed by authigenic kaolinite (11728') or cements (11758'). Mainly low energy; shale colouration and roots suggest non-marine conditions, although possible slight marine influence is indicated by palynofloras. Well laminated, light grey, white and brown sandstones with common green mudflakes. Brown and white sandstones are often inter-laminated. Micaceous silty sandstone and siltstone is present around 11844'. Sandstone similar to this interval is seen on the fault at 11758'. Detrital grains: Simple strained and =strained quartz with scattered feldspar (mainly plagioclase and microcline), locally common muscovite and rare composite quartz and rock fragments (mudflakes with very rare metamorphic quartzites). Clays: Almost entirely detrital clay (probably Male) with rare authigenic kaolinite and illite locally. IV 15/G-3 (5)Ile I. Cements: Common carbonate (possibly dolomite) with minor quartz as thin syntaxial overgrowths. Porosity: Poor to absent; primary porosity probably fair to good but much reduced by cementation and pressure solution. Moderate energy; the ubiquitous thick cros4-bedded sandstone units and green mudflakcs strongly suggest fluvial environment. Burrows and marine palynomorphs are absent. The fades present in this interval may extend up to 11758', because similar rocks are present on fault plane at this depth. Although detailed lithological logging was not carried out, the fades is observed to occur also in Cores and 10 (final cored depth 11978').
