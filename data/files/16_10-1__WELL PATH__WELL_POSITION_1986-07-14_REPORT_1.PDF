(true) from the intended location. Bergen, 16 July 1986 ;// / iL4 John A. Vint Staff/QC Surveyor _DOSEU_2. REQUIREMENTS. The requirements for this project were stated in the Technical Specifications of Radiopositioning and on telex 86/10/385/AC/IVL dated May 1986 from Norsk Agip to Racal Survey Norge. These can be summarized as follows: 1. To navigate and position the drilling rig Dyvi Stena at well location 16/10-1. 2. The intended position was given as: Heading : 315 deg. true 3. The final position was to be no more than 100 NW/SE and 50 NE/SW of intended location. 4. Final position was to be confirmed by Single Point Transit Satellite Position. _CEISETIl_Upon arrival on the rig, the Racal Survey Personnel reported to the Clients Rep. at which time discussion took place as to how the rig would leave its present location and move onto the next location. On completion of this discussion, all the navigation equipment was set up and check fixes taken before leaving location. The rig position was monitored during the recovery of anchors and the tow to the next location. The final positioning at the intended location was carried out using Pulse/8 and the position was continuously monitored during the anchor running. Once the anchors had been run and tensioned, the JMR-4 receiver on board the rig was initialized in the 3D survey mode for the final fix. After this, the radio navigation data was collected and logged to disc. Once enough data had been collected to compute the final fix, permission was obtained from the clients rep. to demobilize all the equipment and return to Bergen. _DEJSCOI_4. SPHEROID AND PROJECTION DATA 4.1 Spheroid Constants Thorughout this report, geographical coordinates are quoted in one of two datums, WGS 72 the Transit satellite datum, and European Datum 1950 (ED-1950). Due to this, each set of geographical coordinates in this report will be annotated with the correct datum. The constants for these datums are listed below: Constant Semi-major axis (a) Semi-minor axis (b) Eccentricity Squared Reciprocal Flattening WGS72 0.006 694 318 4.2 Projection Constants ED-1950 0.006 722 670 All the grid coordinates in this report are in terms of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Projection on the ED-1950 geodetic datum. The constants for this are listed below: Zone Central Meridian (CM) Latitude of Origin False Easting False Northing Scale Factor on CM 3 deg. East 0 deg. North _COCKY!_5. RADIONAVIGATION POSITION FIX COMPUTATIONS 5.1 Pulse/8 Computations The Primary positioning system for the positioning of the Dyvi Stena at well location 16/10-1 was Pulse/8 (Ref. Appendix VI for chain and coordinate data). The coordinates of this location were supplied by Norsk Agip, and are as follows: Longitude: 02 deg. 03' 12.1 which convert to the following UTM grid coordinates: (Zone 31, CM deg. East, ED-1950) Easting : 444 132 Northing: 435 585 During the positioning of the Dyvi Stena at this location, Pulse/8 patterns 1-2, 1-3, and 1-5 in the Southern North Sea chain were used, and have the following configuration: 1 Microsecond time difference is equivalent to: Pattern 1-2 : 155 metres Pattern 1-3 : 165 metres Pattern 1-5 : 248 metres Direction of Patterns: Pattern 1-2 : 154 deg. Pattern 1-3 : 193 deg. Pattern 1-5 : 042 deg. In order to correct for systematic biases in the observed pattern data the following (C-0) values, supplied by Racal Survey Norge, were applied to the raw observed pattern readings before any position fix computations were carried out: Pattern 1-2 : +.08 microsecond Pattern 1-3 : microsecond Pattern 1-5 : microsecond _OCIFOD_Once the rig was on location with the anchors fully tensioned, a set of 1000 Pulse/8 pattern readings were logged during the period 1130 hours to 1230 hours on 29 May 1986. On completion of the logging, the raw pattern readings were listed and any erroneous data edited. This resulted in the following number of pattern readings being used in the final Pulse/8 solution: Pattern 1-2 : 1000 readings Pattern 1-3 : 930 readings Pattern 1-5 : 1000 readings Plots of the Pulse/8 system performance , both before and after editing can be seen in Appendix II. Therefore the data used in the final Pulse/8 positiong fix computation is listed below: Mean Corrected Residuals Pattern Observed (C-0) Observed Weights in Metres 1-2 11 +0.08 11 -1 1-3 26 26 +2 1-5 51 51 -3 The above data was then entered into an offline least squares program on the GNS 26 computer system and the following coordinates obtained for the Pulse/8 antenna position: Easting : 444 134 (Zone 31, CM deg. East, By applying the offset corrections given in Appendix the following position for the rig's derrick centre was obtained: Easting : 444 162 (Zone 31, CM deg. East, These convert to geographical coordinates of: Latitude : 58 deg. 03 (ED-1950) Longitude: 02 deg. 13 13.9 This position is 34 on bearing of 115 deg. (true) from the intended position. _DOCKU_6.1 Observations The satellite observations on Dyvi Stena started once the rig was in its final position, with the anchors tensioned. total of 44 3D single point passes were recorded by the JMR-4 Satnav receiver between 1044, 26 May and 1406, 29 May 1986. These were logged to magnetic data cassette for post processing upon return of the Data to the Racal Survey office in Bergen. 6.2 Datum Change The computation of the recorded satellite data was carried out in the satellite geodetic system (WGS72) and the single point position derived therefore refers to this datum. As the final coordinates for the rig are required in ED-1950 transformation must be applied to convert the coordinates from WGS72 to ED-1950. The parameters used are those recommended during meeting of the National Survey Organisations with concessionary interests in the North Sea (Ref. Ordnance Survey Professional Paper No. 30). These are applicable to the European Continental Shelf north of latitude 47 deg.N and to the North Sea south of 64 deg.N., and are as follows: Dx + Dy + Dz + Note: The above parameters are to convert from Cartesian Coordinates (WGS72) to Cartesian Coordinates (ED-1950). To convert from ED-1950 to WGS72, the mathematical sign of all the parameters must be changed. 6.3 Processing The raw satellite data obtained during this project was recorded on data cassettes by the JMR-4 receiver. This data was then post-processed by Racal Survey Norge in Bergen using EDO's Caliper Satellite Processing Package which runs on an IBM Personnal Computer. From the 44 passes collected on the Rig 35 were accepted by the Single Point Solution. _DEE02!_I. The balance of these passes is shown below: II I North South East West Each pass taken into the solution also had minimum of 10, 30 second doppler counts. From these passes, the following satellite antenna position on the Dyvi Stena was derived: Longitude: 02 deg. 03' Height : in N E (WGS72) By applying the datum shifts in the previous section, this position was then transformed to ED-1950: Longitude: 02 deg. 03' (ED-1950) This converts to UTM coordinates of: Easting : 444 (Zone 31, CM deg.East Northing: 435 in ED-1950) The quality of the pass data and the position fix can be indicated by three criteria: 1. The RMS of the scatter of dopplers for particular pass, 2. The one sigma values of the final position, 3. The variance/co-variance factor for the adjustment. From the data processed, mean RMS of was obtained for the doppler data. This is little higher than the expected value of in to for data collected offshore and is probably due to local interference or movement on the Rig. Despite the noiser than normal data, the one sigma values for the final processed position were good, value of in _DOSCE!!_latitude and in in longitude. This resulted in one sigma value in position of in. The variance/co-variance factor for the adjustment was 0.81. 6.4 Reduction to Well Centre The position obtained for the antenna was as follows: Easting : 444 in (Zone 31, CM deg. East By applying the traverse corrections in Appendix No. 9, the following position is obtained for the Well centre:  This converts to geographical coordinates of: This position is 50 metres on bearing 141 deg. (true) from the intended location. _GETSOCI_7. COMPARISON BETWEEN RADIONAVIGATION AND SATELLITE FIXED POSITION 7.1 Pulse/8 and Satellite Single Point Positions The Well Centre Position derived from 35 3D satellite passes, with an orientation of deg. from grid north for the rig is: Easting : 444 (UTM Zone 31, CM deg. East, Northing: 435 ED-1950) The Well Centre Position derived by Pulse/8 using patterns 1-2, 1-3, and 1-5 in the Southern North Sea Chain, and with the same orientation as above is: Easting : 444 162 (UTM Zone 31, CM deg. East, This gives deviation of 25 metres on bearing of 358 deg. (grid) from the satellite single point position to the Pulse/8 fixed position. This is represented diagrammatically along with the deviations from the intended location in Appendix VII. To enable comparison to be made between the Pulse/8 (C-0) values used for navigation, and those values derived from the satellite single point fixed position, the position of the derrick centre derived by this method was converted to the Pulse/8 antenna position by applying the offsets shown in Appendix V. These coordiantes are as follows: Easting : 444 134 (UTM Zone 31, CM deg. East, Pulse/8 pattern readings were then computed for this location and are as follows: Pattern 1-2 : Pattern 1-3 : Pattern 1-5 : _OLTSLIg_Using the mean observed pattern values, new (C-0) values for this location can be established as follows: Pattern Computed Observed (C-0) 1-2 + 1-3 - 1-5 - _CEICeL12!_8.
