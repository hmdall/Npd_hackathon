The drilling fluid for the sections with returns to the surface was selected based on: 1. Salinity selection based on hydrate suppression calculation. 2. Inhibition based on laboratory tests performed on cuttings from the offset well drilled by Norsk Hydro in 1997. 3. Selection of lubricant/ROP enhancer based on results from the DEA 90 project tests on ROP improvement. 4. The mud had few components which were included for specific purpose. 5. The mud formulation had to have low formation damage potential. 6. The mud components would not interfere with show interpretation. The SFT, the state pollution authority, was given request to use the DRIL-N-SLIDE in the mud on this well and to discharge the mud to the sea as required. The discharge permit was granted with the following restrictions: 1. The level of the DRIL-N-SLIDE to be kept as low as possible to achieve our ROP goals in the 12 1/4 hole interval up to maximum content of 4%. 2. There would be no discharge of whole mud from the mud pits. 3. The SFT would be provided with report on the performance and how the restrictions were met. The KCl/NaCI PAC drilling fluid with to 4% DRIL-N-SLIDE content was selected for the intermediate and reservoir sections. The testing fluid requirements were more straight forward: 1. solids free, filtered brine (probably sodium chloride brine) was required. 2. The density requirements would be known after the obtaining pressure data from the logging. 3. kill pill would be required to kill the well at the end of the testing program. 4. All the fluids had to go through the sand control screens which had 200 micron openings. The sodium chloride brine was selected for the testing fluid and BARAPLUG (sized salt) kill pill which has been used on Ula/Gyda was selected for the kill pill.CONCLUSIONS riserless sections: Once again found that the bentonite did not yield rapidly enough to be used as spud mud or sweeps on its own. The amount of prehydrated bentonite allowed by the variable deck load did not give the minimum required 12 hours hydration time. BARAZAN PLUS was used to viscosify the spud mud due to lower quantity of this product was required to reach the desired viscosity. 12 1/4 inch section: The mud system performed extremely well throughout this section. And this was despite the fact that the dilution rate for the section was 0.63 bbl/m, compared with programmed figure of bbl/m. There are several reasons for this dramatic improvement to the programmed requirements: 1. The selected drilling fluid exhibited the required inhibition and rheology for hole cleaning. The cuttings were large and firm and the dilution rate was 61% of the planned dilution rate. The PWD information and the trip out of the hole confirmed that the hole and riser were being cleaned without any excess circulation time. 2. The selection of the new diamond drill bit combined with the selection of the lubricant/ROP enhancer, DRIL-N-SLIDE suggest that the findings in the DEA 90 project were valid as the average rate of penetration for the 12 1/4 interval was in excess of 37 meters per hour and no bit balling was encountered. The data aquisition requirements were met as the top of the Balder was found and the TD of the 12 1/4 was accurately picked which would allow the top of the reservoir to be logged in the 1/2 hole interval. Reservoir section: The KCl/NaCl PAC mud used on the 12 1/4 inch interval was treated to meet the specifications required for coring and then utilized on this interval. The following key parameters for the coring were given special attention: 1. Low fluid loss to minimize mud filtrate invasion into the core and the formation. 2. Low concentration of drilled solids to enable the mud to drain easily from the annulus between the core and the aluminum barrel. 3. No treatment during the coring operation was to be made to the mud system which could change core wettability or fluid composition. 4. Low gel strength/low end rheology to minimize whole mud injection from surge pressure.All these criteria were met and these factors were major contribution to the high core recovery on the very successful coring operation on this well. Testing: The well was cleaned up and displaced to filtered sodium chloride brine successfully. The successful test was carried out and the well was killed. There were indications that some plugging of the screens may have occurred. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS IN THIS AREA: 1. Riserless intervals: Alternative viscosifiers to bentonite should be considered if the deck load limitations are so close that there is insufficient time to allow the bentonite to yield. careful economic evaluation must be done to determine the most effective solution to be used. The use of bentonite extenders such as N-VIS HI should be examined and solutions to the foaming problem should be determined i.e. eliminate sources of air entrapment, mixing procedures, etc. 2. Intermediate and reservoir intervals: The restricted discharge of mud by the SFT caused 1803 bbl to be sent to Gyda for injection. In future wells the case should be brought to the attention of the environmental department at the first opportunity - at least months in advance of spud. Alternative more environmentally friendly lubricant/ROP enhancers should be evaluated by Baroid's & group. The same evaluation of mud types should be carried out on future wells as the second offset well (being drilled after this well) is experiencing hole stability problems with similar mud formulation (no DRIL-N-SLIDE). They feel it is density problem, so all offset data that is available should be used in the evaluation. 3. Testing interval: The testing went well and in the future evaluation and selection of kill pills should consider: a. It was noted that there was no sign of sand on the screens and this raises the question of whether sand control screens are absolutly necessary. b. BARAPLUG Fine should be used in future pills to ensure that all of the plugging particles will pass through the screens. The BARAPLUG has a small amount of particles in the 200+ micron range. c. Alternative kill fluids that could be used would be BARACARB (sized calcium carbonate). This fluid would be screened to remove large particles i.e. at least 150 mesh (100 micron) screens. 05-11-9d. Another solution would be to kill the well with drilling mud that has been screened with at least mesh size of 150 (100 microns). Finer mesh screens would be recommended. e. Any future formulations should have flow through test run on it to ensure that the screens are not plugged. The planning that went into the design and use of the fluids on this well resulted in well that was drilled quickly, safely and with minimum of problems. All of the objectives were met. It is recommended that this planning process be applied to the selection of the fluids in future wells.ap Total Material Consumption Material Unit size Quantity Total cost (Kr) BARAPLUG FINE 25 KG.

Hole Section Objective : To spud well, to drill the 36 42 inch section to 961 meters and to set and cement the 36 30 inch conductor. Summary : The rig arrived on location on the 6th of July 1998 and seabed survey was performed by the ROV. Once the rig was in position, the 42 36 26 inch spudding assembly was made up and run in hole and the well was spudded at 883 meters below the rotary table. The hole was drilled with seawater and high viscosity sweeps to 925 meters. The survey tool malfunctioned at this depth and after dropping a single shot survey and displacing the hole to SG spud mud, the bit was pulled out. The faulty survey tool was changed out and the drill string was run in again. The hole was drilled to the section TD at 961 meters and the hole was again displaced to SG mud. wiper trip to the seabed and back to TD showed the hole to be in good condition and so the drill string was pulled to surface. The 30 inch conductor was run and cemented as per program. Density : The high viscosity sweeps were SG and the displacement mud left in hole when pulling out was SG. Rheology and hole cleaning : The sweeps were made with prehydrated bentonite at 30 ppb and were then cut 50:50 with seawater and the funnel viscosity was adjusted to 100 + sec/qt by the addition of to 1.0 ppb of BARAZAN PLUS. The hole condition was observed to be good at all times with little or no drag and normal torque levels. This indicated that the sweeps were cleaning the hole well. The SG mud was made in the same way as the sweeps but the viscosity was lower at 50 sec/qt. This mud weight proved adequate in stabilizing the hole when tripping. Mud properties : Only density and funnel viscosity were measured. Solids control : All returns were to the seabed. Variances from mud program : The trip to replace the faulty survey tool necessitated an extra displacement to SG mud. This reduced the time available for hydration of the bentonite and therefore increased the consumption of BARAZAN PLUS as well as increasing the mud volume requirements. The cost of the mud built was 131,570 NOK over the programmed mud cost, but this included the cost of the 1587 bbl of spud mud carried over to the 17 1/2 section. The use of the BARAZAN PLUS accounted for 28% of the excess cost, N-VIS HI accounted for 18% of the excess cost and the other products in the 1587 bbl of mud carried over to the accounted for the rest. The use of these polymers gave adequate rheology to clean the hole without shutting the rig down to allow the bentonite to hydrate. 29-10-9 BAROID Division of Baroid Corp Company: Well Name: Contractor: Rig: BP Norge Country: NORWAY 6305/7-1 Geo Area: MORE BASIN Diamond Offshore Field: BARDEN PL208 Ocean Alliance Region: Mid-Norway Interval # 02 in. Hole Section Objective : To drill the 17 1/2 inch hole to 1700 meters and to set 13 3/8 inch surface casing. Summary : The first bit run was with 26 bit to clean out the 30 casing. While going to the seabed with the drill string, the ROV failed. Without the ROV it was not possible to stab into the top of the 30 inch casing. The bit was pulled while the ROV was retrieved and repaired. The rig carried out critical path tasks while waiting in order to minimize the unproductive time. With the ROV repaired, the 26 inch clean out trip was made and cement was drilled from 941 metres. The shoe track was cleaned out with seawater and meter of new formation was drilled. After taking check survey, the 17 1/2 inch assembly was made up and RIH. The section was drilled to TD of 1708 meters, pumping seawater and high viscosity pills every 15 meters. At TD the hole was displaced to SG bentonite/seawater mud and check trip was made to the 30 inch shoe. There was overpull of 20 to 25 klbs between 1455 and 1430 meters and some drag at the same depth when RIH again to TD, otherwise the hole was in good shape. second displacement was then carried out, this time with NaCl/KCl/GEM brine transferred from the last well and weighted to SG. The 13 3/8 20 inch combined casing string was then run and cemented to shoe depth of 1696 meters, as per program. Density : The high viscosity sweeps were SG and the kill/displacement mud was SG. Rheology and hole cleaning : The PWD tool was run in this section and showed good correlation between the high viscosity sweeps and the ECD. Each time the sweeps passed the bit, the real-time ECD would rise until the sweep was out of the hole (i.e. at the seabed) and then the ECD would drop back to value less than it was before the sweep. In this way we were able to see that the sweep program was effective and did not need to be changed. The sweeps were mixed using prehydrated bentonite (30 ppb) cut 50:50 with seawater and then viscosified with BARAZAN PLUS or N-VIS HI. The funnel viscosity was 100 sec/qt or above. The displacement mud was mixed in the same manner and viscosified to 50 sec/qt prior to weighting up. Solids control : Returns to seabed.Variances from mud program : The time required for the bentonite to yield fully again proved to be too long to allow the sweep mud to be made entirely from bentonite and seawater. For this reason BARAZAN PLUS was used to viscosify the sweeps and the kill mud. Attempts were made to use N-VIS HI, but this caused the unweighted pills to foam so that the pumps had difficulty in maintaining suction. The mud cost of the volume built in this section was 5,813 NOK more than was programmed. The use of BARAZAN PLUS and N-VIS HI to increase the viscosity did not affect the section cost due to the 1587 bbl of spud mud transferred from the previous section. Again the use of these products allowed the mud rheology to be achieved without shutting the rig down to allow the bentonite to yield.Ak Contractor: Diamond Offshore Field: BARDEN PL208 Mir Rig: Ocean Alliance Region: Mid-Norway Interval # 03 in. Hole Section Objective : To drill the 12 1/4 inch hole in timely and safe manner and to set 5/8 inch casing, with no problems, at depth dependent upon the geological pick for the top of the Balder (Tare) formation. The hole should be in gauge as defined - maximum of inch washout would not cause any problems for data aquisition and for cementing was confirmed by the data aquisition and well integrity teams. The use of DRIL-N-SLIDE, for torque reduction and to combat bit balling, was allowed by the Norwegian environmental agency, SFT, if no whole mud was dumped from the pits and the product volume was no more than 4%. Summary : The BOP and riser package was run and landed without incident. During the running of the riser, 3115 barrels of NaCl/KCI ip brine were received on board the rig. PAC-L and BARAZAN PLUS polymers were mixed into the brine and DRIL-N-SLIDE lubricant at 1/2% was mixed also. The new mud was not weighted up until the BOPs had been function tested, in case the mud had to be backloaded in the event of the riser package having to be pulled. After testing the BOPs, the recommended 12 1/4 inch bit was made up and RIH. The float and plug and cement in the shoe track was drilled from 1669 meters. The cement proved harder than anticipated and total of hours were spent drilling out. leak-off test was performed to SG equivalent mud weight. The hole was drilled to 2450 meters at an average ROP of 73 m/hr. At this depth the ROP was controlled to allow for more accurate pick of the top of the Balder (Tare) formation. Once the Balder (Tare) had been confirmed from the real-time gamma log, the ROP was no longer controlled and the hole was drilled to section TD of 2819 meters at an average ROP of m/hr. Torque values were less than expected throughout the section, Ak especially at the beginning (3,000 to 4,000 foot pounds). Increases IIP lower down (up to 6,000 foot pounds) were attributed chipped cutters rather than to the formation or mud. One possible reason for the low torque figures is the inclusion of 2.5% by volume of DRIL-N-SLIDE, Baroid's drilling lubricant and bit-balling prevention agent. The drilling optimization engineer on board for this section, expressed his opinion that the DRIL-N-SLIDE was significant factor in reducing rotating torque. The 5/8 casing was run after carrying out electric logging. The wire line logging tool hung up 10 meters from TD. There was some suggestion that this may have been fill in the bottom of the hole, but it was felt that this was unlikely given that the hole had been left static for less than 24 hours at this point and that the caliper log showed the hole to be in extremely good condition. The idea that the mud had sagged and that the fill was barite can also be excluded, because, for there to have been this much barite in the hole, the bottom 225 meters of the mud column would have had to have dropped all its barite. This was proved not be the case when circulating the Ak casing prior to the cement job. The return mud weight remained within W0.005 SG of SG at all times. 04-11-9Company: BP Norge Country: NORWAY Well Name: 6305/7-1 Geo Area: MORE BASIN Contractor: Diamond Offshore Field: BARDEN PL208 Rig: Ocean Alliance Region: Mid-Norway The casing was set at shoe depth of 2809 meters. The last 30 meters of the casing had to washed down. This was most likely to be the casing hanging up rather than fill for the reasons outlined above. The casing was landed while circulating at 18 bbls/min and circulation was temporarily lost to the formation. The pumps were slowed down and circulation was re-established at 12 bbls/min with no losses. Losses during this period were 231 barrels. The casing was then cemented as per program with only minor mud losses (39 barrels). 342 bbl of mud was left behind the casing. Mud losses for the section was 758 bbl of mud lost over the solids control equipment with the cuttings, 23 bbl dumped when cleaning out the shale shaker box for total of 781 bbl to the sea. There was 342 bbl left behind the casing and 270 bbl lost to the formation during the casing and cement job. Density : The mud was weighted to SG before drilling out and this weight was maintained throughout the section. The PWD tool showed that the mud weight on displacement was even with no light or heavy spots, which is unusual in newly mixed up mud. This shows that great care was taken in the initial mixing of the mud. There was no increase in the mud weight and no light mud was required to maintain the density. All fresh dilution mud was weighted to SG before addition to the system. The centrifuge, when run for hours on minimum feed rate showed sharp decrease in the mud weight and was stopped immediately. Rheology and hole cleaning : The mud was mixed with BARAZAN PLUS concentration of pounds per barrel (ppb). This is half the programmed concentration and was deliberately kept low to avoid the cold mud becoming too viscous before it had been sheared. As on previous wells the rheology was checked at the flow line temperature. This was to avoid excessively high rheologies at the low circulating temperatures experienced in the riser. The PV was initially high at over 40 cp, but this soon dropped as the mud sheared. The and rpm viscometer readings and the gel strengths were low due to the reduced concentration of BARAZAN PLUS and due to the lack of dispersion of the drilled solids. Hole cleaning was monitored closely by observing the quantity of cuttings at the shakers and by monitoring the drilling parameters, especially the torque and drag on connections and the pump pressure and PWD tool's real-time ECD measurement. There were no signs of poor hole cleaning at any time and when tripping out, the hole proved to be in excellent condition with no overpull experienced. The caliper log run during the electric logging, showed the hole to be washed out by only 3% on average, with no tight spots or washouts. This average hole diameter of inches met the previously agreed upon criteria of gauge hole.Interval Discussion The rheology of the mud system was increased by the addition of ppb of BARAZAN PLUS direct to the active, while drilling the last 100 meters of the section. This treatment was deemed to be necessary to ensure that the mud left down hole would not sag and was based on pilot tests carried out at the expected bottom-hole temperature of 80 degrees C. Mud properties : All mud properties were within programmed specifications during this section, except for the rheological properties mentioned above and for the PH and KCl values, (see Variances from Mud Program). Solids control : The four Derrick shakers were dressed with 14 mesh top screens and 60 mesh bottom screens before drilling out. Once the mud had been displaced into the hole and drilling had started the bottom screens were changed up to 125 mesh. Although this mesh size would be considered too coarse for most 12 1/4 inch hole sections, this did not prove to be the case on this well. The combination of large firm cuttings and good inhibition caused the vast majority of the drilled solids to be processed over the top screens. In short the mud and bit caused the solids control to work so efficiently that finer screens were unnecessary. Screen usage for the 1,111 meter section was; one top screen and bottom screens. One shaker was changed up to 150 mesh screens with little or no difference in the quantity of cuttings processed and while it would have been possible to change the bottom screens of the remaining three shakers to finer mesh size, it was felt that this was not necessary and the 125 mesh screens were left on the shakers until the end of the section. A solids control equipment service engineer was on board prior to drilling out. He carried out full service on the two centrifuges. The number (low speed) machine had some severe corrosion around an electrical junction-box and was shut down, for safety reasons, by the rig electrician. The remaining centrifuge was run for hours on the first day of drilling. There proved to be so few drilled solids in the mud that the centrifuge was merely stripping barite out of the system and was shut down after hours. Variances from mud program :The pH was affected by the drilling of the cement in the shoe track and rose to maximum of just after drilling out. As soon as drilling commenced after the LOT, the pH was reduced to within the programmed range by the addition of fresh mud with pH of 8.5. The initial potassium chloride concentration of the make-up brine was 26 ppb. This fell to minimum of ppb at 2078 meters. The drop in potassium chloride concentration reflects the high depletion rate experienced. Additions of MT of potassium chloride were made direct to the active and pit of 250 barrels of potassium chloride brine was made up at 53 ppb. PAC-L and BARAZAN PLUS were mixed into this new brine and it was bled into the active as premix to increase the potassium chloride level to final concentration of 27 ppb. 29-10-9 BAROID Division of Baroid CorpThe mud cost for the volume built in this interval was 351,083 NOK less than was programmed. This was due to the low dilution rate required in this interval. An additional 2,289 NOK was charged off for broken sacks of returned material found when it was received at the warehouse. Interval # 04 in. Hole Section Objective : To drill hole to top of the Egga sand formation, then core the reservoir sand section and drill to the planned TD of the well at 3411 meters BRT. The mud product additions will cease during coring to ensure nothing is done to alter the characteristics of the core due to changes in the drilling fluid. Summary : After 10 days of suspended well operations due to regional fishery restrictions, the drilling operation could proceed on the 1st of August. First the riser was displaced back to mud at SG. The pipe was then RIH and on every 10th stand the mud in the hole was circulated for minutes to break the gels. The cement was tagged at 2794 meters. After cleaning out the casing, shoe track and rat hole, meters of new formation was drilled. The leak off test gave SG equivalent mud weight. Drilling proceeded from 2821 meters through mainly clay stone to 2917 meters. Both MWD and the samples from the shakers confirmed that sand had penetrated at 2906 meters. The bit was pulled to change to the coring assembly. During the following days, total of cores were cut with lengths and % of recovery as follows: Core # 1: from 2917 meters to 2944 meters - with 99.3% recovery. Core # 2: from 2944 meters to 2971 meters - with 100.0% recovery. Core # 3: from 2971 meters to meters - with 95.5% recovery. Core # 4: from meters to meters - with 97.3% recovery. This high percent recovery rate of the cores was far above expectations. The remaining part of the section, which consisted of soft mudstone with an occasional limestone stringer, was drilled in hours to TD of the well at 3377 meters. wiper trip was first made to the shoe to check the condition of the hole. The reservoir sand section was found very sticky and the pipe hade to be pumped and/or back reamed out of the hole. The same sticking tendencies were expected after the wiper trip when pulling the BHA through the reservoir the second time. (Max over pull was 145 klbs at 2954 meters.) The string was finally pulled to surface and the preparations were made to start the wire line logging program. The active system was treated continuously with premixed PAC at concentration of ppb in full concentration KCl/NaCl brine while drilling. The dilution rate varied from bbl/hr - to bbl/hr. When drilling the lower part of the interval from the end of the cored section to TD the active system was treated with 4000 kg potassium chloride in Addition to the premix dilution to maintain the potassium chloride concentration between 22 ppb and 25 ppb. No additions were made to the active system while coring. After cutting each core, the open hole volume was circulated. Due to the relatively low gas levels recorded (5.4 % from the top of the reservoir), it was not necessary to spot any MEG glycol pills for hydrate suppression in the BOP throughout the interval.The well was logged by Schlumberger and the final logging program was completed successfully 14 hrs ahead of the scheduled time. The maximum static bottom hole temperature at TD was recorded to degrees with the FMI/DSI-log. Density : The density was maintained at SG throughout the interval. Rheology and hole cleaning : The rheology was maintained within the recommended levels for the section. At any time, there was no indication that these parameters were inadequate for good hole cleaning. Mud properties : The pH-readings were recorded from at the beginning of the interval to at TD of the well. It was not necessary to make any treatment to reduce that level since the Pf/Mf readings remained very low throughout the interval. All the other mud properties were maintain within recommended levels. Solids control : The four Derrick shakers in use operated as expected with good handling capacity taking into account the problems created by the low flow line temperatures throughout the interval. The flow line temperature ranged from 12 to 15 degrees C. The initial configuration of shaker screen were: At the end of the interval, the following mesh sizes were in use: The drill crews were instructed to use second hand screens whenever possible to limit the requirement for new screens. Both centrifuges had been serviced prior to drilling this section and after test run, no irregularities were experienced. When running centrifuge number on the active system, the efficiency was as experienced before. Processing SG mud gave liquid phase weight of to SG. Centrifuge number was not run on the active system on this interval. Variances from mud program : As per discussion of Mud properties (above) Rig: Ocean Alliance Region: Mid-Norway The discharge permit called for no discharge of whole mud from the pits. MT of DRIL-N-SLIDE was discharged down hole to the formation or left behind the liner during the cement job. MT of DRIL-N-SLIDE was in the mud backloaded to the work boat and MT was discharged with the 61 MT cuttings of cuttings and during the clean up of the pits and mud lines. 1002 barrels of fluid were dumped during this interval. 889 barrels was premix and brine without any DRIL-N-SLIDE content and the remaining 113 bbl was unrecoverable volume from the pits and mud lines when cleaning and contaminated mud from the cement job. The cost of the mud volume built in this interval was 21,902 NOK less than was programmed. This was due to the volume of premix carried over from the previous section. The objectives for this section were accomplished. The discharge  permit restrictions were met as no whole mud was discharged and only 1.82 MT of the DRIL-N-SLIDE was discharged as compared with the to 10 MT estimated in the request for discharge. This was accomplished by backloading 1800 barrels of mud with MT of DRIL-N-SLIDE in it. 05-1 -9Company: BP Norge Country: NORWAY Well Name: 6305/7-1 Geo Area: MORE BASIN Contractor: Diamond Offshore Field: BARDEN PL208 Rig: Ocean Alliance Region: Mid-Norway Interval # 05 in. Hole Section Objective : Displace the well to seawater, clean up the well and displace the well to filtered SG sodium chloride brine. Test the reservoir sand zone. Kill the well, pull the test string and P&A the well. Summary : The pits, mixing lines and transfer lines were thoroughly cleaned. 584 bbl new sodium chloride brine at SG was received from land and was filtered to 10 microns and 20 NTU. After filtration, the brine was diluted with drill water to SG. A pressure controlled displacement to seawater was done before the wash pills were pumped and the sodium chloride brine pill was displaced into the well. Due to the quick drop in NTU on the seawater while displacing out the mud, the wash pills were displaced with 600 bbl of seawater and then the filtered SG brine. When the brine displacement was started, the NTU on the seawater 20. 1800 bbl of SG mud was transfered to the supply boat during the displacement to seawater. No mud was stored on the rig during the test. The test was accomplished as per program. A 60 bbl kill pill was made up with saturated sodium chloride brine, N-DRIL HT, BARAPLUG and BARAPLUG Fine. The rheology was adjusted with small amounts of BARAZAN PLUS. An additional volume of SG sodium chloride brine was made up. 1615 bbl mud was received and was diluted with seawater to SG. The rheology of the mud was adjusted with BARAZAN PLUS. This was done in order to have enough volume for the killing operation. The contents of the tubing string was bled down to the flare and the circulating ports were opened. 1/2 times the tubing volume was reverse circulated with the SG sodium chloride brine. 40 bbl kill pill was spotted inside the tubing above the iris valve. One attempt was made to bullhead through the screens. Two bbl were bullheaded on this attempt. The circulating ports were opened and the remaining 38 bbl of the kill pill were displaced to the annulus. An attempt was made to bullhead the kill pill to annulus after the ports were closed and the test string was pulled out of the packer with no apparent injection to the perforations. When the gauges were recovered, it was found that the perforations were taking very small amount of fluid when bullheading the annulus. During the plug and abandonment operation, the perforations were bullheaded with mud and bbl of mud was injected to the formation. The tubing string and annulus were displaced to SG mud. The riser was displaced to SG KCl/NaCl/Polymer mud via the choke line. flow check was performed and the well was dead. The test string was pulled out of the hole with the annulus volume being circulated once. No gas was observed on this circulation.Well Name: 6305/7-1 Geo Area: MCRE BASIN Interval Discussion The sand screens were covered by salt particles. There was some unsheared polymer material on the gauge housing below the sand screens. Lab analysis shows that there was no starch (N-DRIL HT) in the polymer. This polymer mass probably came from one of the high viscosity pills which had no N-DRIL HT content. This could have been caused by an unsheared volume of BARAZAN PLUS that settled to bottom or was in the wellhead when the test string was run in the hole. The kill pill was checked for fish eyes (unsheared polymer) constantly during the mixing of the pill. No fish eyes were observed during the mixing and none were found in the sample of the circulated kill pill sent to the Baroid lab. The kill pill sample particle size distribution (PSD) analysis showed that 90% of the kill pill particles were below 90 microns. Approximately 0.5% was greater than 191 microns. Analysis of the material plugging the bottom of the screens and of the material covering the screens indicated that the material collected after the screens were sent to town was sodium chloride (salt i.e BARAPLUG) with minor insoluble contaminants. After killing the well and the test string was pulled out of the hole. cement stinger of 3/8 tubing and 10 stands of 1/2 drill pipe was made up and run to 2945 meters. One string volume was circulated and no gas was found. The perforations were bullheaded one more time with mud. barrels of mud were injected through the perforations. 20 bbl fresh water spacer was pumped, followed by 55 bbl of cement slurry and bbl of spacer. This was displaced with 140 bbl of mud. There were no losses during cement job. The cement string was pulled back to 2466 meters which was approximately 100 meters over the theoretical top of the cement. The string volume was reverse circulated out. Just traces of cement were seen on bottoms up. good pressure test was performed to 2500 psi. The cement stinger was pulled out of the hole. A bridge plug was set in the 5/8 casing at 1090 meters. The 5/8 casing was successfully cut at meters and was pulled out of hole. cement plug was set meters above the bridge plug. The choke and kill lines and the riser were displaced to seawater at the maximum flow rate. 1618 bbl of SG mud was backloaded on to the Far Spirit for injection on the Gyda platform at later date. The DRILI-N-SLIDE content was 0.9% when back loading the mud. Density: The brine for testing had density of SG. The kill pill had density of SG. The well was displaced to SG KCl/NaCl/Pac mud when the well was killed. Mud properties : All mud properties was according to the specifications. Solids control : The four Derrick shakers were dressed with old screens. There were 14 mesh top screens on all four shale shakers. Two of the shale shakers were dressed with 125 mesh bottom screens, one was dressed with 100 mesh bottom screens and the last one was dressed with 84 mesh bottom screens. 29-10-9 BAROID Division of Baroid CorpS  Variances from mud program : The displacement to filtered brine began before the wash pills had reached the surface. 40 bbl of kill pill were pumped instead of 20 bbl. The kill pill plugged the perforations and possibly the sand screens during the killing operation. It was planned to plug only the perforations. The discharge permit permit called for no discharge of whole mud from the mud pits. MT of DRIL-N-SLIDE was left in the hole when the well was plugged and abandoned. MT of DRIL-N-SLIDE was in the mud that was back loaded on to the work boat for injection on Gyda at a later time. The actual cost of materials used in the fluids used during the this interval was 33,643 NOK less than was programmed. This was due to the reduced requirement for SG sodium chloride brine because the required density was lower. The miscellaneous cost - 117,934 NOK was the cost of the broken sacks of returned materials to the ware house - 12,002 NOK and the difference in the cost of the bulk materials (MEG, barite and bentonite) transferred to the next well - 105,932 NOK. These bulk materials were credited at the new location's (UK) prices which were lower than the price of the products from Kristiansund.Interval Material Consumption Interval #01 42x36x26 in.
