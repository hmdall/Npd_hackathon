WELL : 33/9-18 VSP PROCESSING COMMENT The quality of direct arrival data recorded by the VSP survey in this well is generally good, although there is casing noise interference on all levels at and above 1200 measured depth below KB, and the levels at and 1960 were unusable due to poor coupling of the geophone to the formation. Levels at and above 1370 were omitted from VSP processing as their data are not at VSP spacing. Direct arrivals gradually become less sharp with increasing depth, perhaps due to earth filtering effects smearing together the direct and secondary peaks of the downwave train. Levels used in the VSP are all affected to slight degree by tubewave noise. 13 sample median was used for obtaining downwave estimate untainted by this noise, the result of which can be seen in Display VB2. This estimate of the downwaves is also used for deterministic deconvolution of the data. However, for downwave subtraction it was found best to use downwaves estimated by sample median operator, this giving the optimum downwave subtraction whilst also allowing for some attenuation of the tubewave noise. However, some residual noise energy (both tubewave and some shear wave arrivals) still resides in the upgoing wavefield estimate, affecting coherency of events away from the time-depth curve. The final enhancement, which after numerous trials was chosen to be dip filter with to ms/trace dip allowed, further attenuates this noise. There is reasonable match between the VSP and surface seismic data, also with synthetic seismogram data. Traces from the in-line seismic section that cuts the well location (Row 1127 from Seismic Survey CTM-94) have been included in both the zero and minimum phase Seismic Correlation Worksheets (which have been produced at 10 and 20 cm/s). The filtering applied to the VSP data, for the purpose of matching it against surface seismic data, comprises time-variant bandpass filter, the same as that applied to the supplied seismic data for survey CTM-94, plus Ricker wavelet.

The edited data is aligned accurately, using cross correlation methods, prior to summation of common depth traces. Unless otherwise stated, source signature deconvolution is applied to marine data using the source monitor signal as source signature in order to remove the source bubble and to account for any slight variation in source output. A broad band (preliminary) filter is applied in order to remove noise without compromising the usable bandwidth of the data. DISPLAY VA(FK) F-K Transformation of Stacked Geophone data at one-way time This display is used for analysis of the frequency bandwidth of the data, to aid design of the preliminary filter. The stacked geophone data (after source signature deconvolution, if appropriate) at one-way time, is transformed into F-K space. It is displayed as wavenumber (K) against frequency, with colour variation indicating amplitude in dB below peak amplitude. A velocity alignment in T-X space transforms to an alignment in F-K space, rotated through 90; the various wavefields (velocity alignments) commonly observed in T-X space transform into F-K space as illustrated in Figure 1. The strongest wavefield will normally be the downgoing wavefield and this transforms into an alignment from zero wave number, zero frequency, sloping in the positive wavenumber direction Significant velocity changes in wavefield will result in multiple alignments in F-K space; it may not be possible to differentiate between the different alignments and the resulting event may be smeared.33/9-18 DISPLAY: VA(FK)  PART OF FK ANALYSIS INPUT: Stacked geophone data (oneway time) after source signature cleconvolution LEVELS: 127  165 WINDOW:  seconds FILTER: None FREQUENCY ( 2) WAVENUME1ER (CYCLES/TRACE) RELATIVE AMP UTUDE (d13) 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 -44 48 0.5 10- 20- 30- 4J0- 50- 130- 70- 80- 90- 100- 110- 120- 1N-4 0.SINPUT: Stacked geophane data (oneway time) after source signature deconvaIution LEVELS: 70  126 FILTER; None FREQUENCY (H 2) -0.5 WAVEN UMBER (CYCLES/TRACE) -4 -12 -16 -20 -24 -28 -32 -36 -4-0 -48  -   -. -iim- -..vo ,. -.....-  -0.-  - ___ __________ .ifianms..-4,m. -  ...ar- - - - .. ........ -; - - -15 - - - - - , . ___ _ aw.- -, - - .... mr.

This data is filtered using the 'maximum bandwidth' filter designed after F-K analysis to determine the usable bandwidth of the upgoing wavefield. In marine data, if source signature deconvolution has been applied, then the input wavelet is zero phase and the wavelet contained in the data is zero phase modified by earth absorption and transmission loss effects (ie mixed phase). Events that reach the time-depth curve are primary and their lithologic significance can be established unequivocally by reference to the calibrated velocity log. Multiples having their last bounce from primary within the range of the VSP may be identified by observing their termination in the data at the same depth point at which the primary cuts the time-depth curve. From this display, any dip across the well location can be recognised by moveout of the primary event to shorter time, as the geophone moves up the well and away from the lithology creating the reflection. No azimuth of dip can be computed from this display but true dip can be computed from measurement of the AT against vertical depth increment. Unconformities may be recognised by an abrupt change of moveout of adjacent primary events. Topographical features up-dip away from the well may be recognised by an increase in the AT or in the termination of an event away from the time-depth curve. Dip increasing up-dip away from the well can be observed in the data; however, if dip is decreasing up-dip (ie crest of an anticline) then the event in question will disappear from the data. Dip can be calculated using the method described in the Appendix contained in this report. DISPLAY VC(FK) F-K Display of Upgoing Wavefield at two-way time before enhancement This display is used in the design of the 'maximum bandwidth' filter in conjunction with the F-K display of the deconvolved upgoing wavefield and filter trials. It shows the data from the upgoing wavefield at two-way time transformed into F-K space. Any filter applied to the data before transformation is noted on the display. Since the upgoing wavefield is aligned horizontally, or near horizontally, in T-X space (unless there is steep dip across the well location) it is aligned vertically, through zero wavenumber, in F-K space. The 'maximum bandwidth' filter is the least restrictive filter that can be applied to the upgoing wavefield to remove noise whilst retaining resolution of the data in the zone of interest. The F-K analysis is therefore performed on data within window around the zone of interest. Additionally, the data is windowed in time so that data analysed is close to the time-depth curve, where we would expect better resolution. If the zone of interest is not known, it is assumed to be just above T.D. of the well.33/9 DISPLAY: VC(FK) INPUT: Upgoing Wavefield (twoway time) LEVELS:  87 AM PlclADE  15 3Z 35  44  413 WAVEN MB ER cCYCLES/TRACE) 05 05YELL: 33,9-10 RIG SOURCE SURVEY DISPLAY - UC PRELIMINARY FILTER - HZ DOWNWAVE SUBTRACTION MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH FILTER - HZ WW L..)

It shows the data from Display VC after application of deterministic deconvolution using operators derived from the downgoing wavefield on trace by trace basis. The effect of the deconvolution is to remove all reverberants associated with at least one reflector above the geophone position from which the downgoing wavefield has been extracted. The deconvolution is applied in spiking mode, unless otherwise stated, and the phase of the resulting data will be function of the filter applied after deconvolution. This is normally zero phase filter giving zero phase result and maximum resolution of the lithology within the band limits.

BSD/VSP/SSSD.2 DISPLAY VB2 Downgoing Wavefield This display enables identification of residual multiples in the surface seismic data. The data shown in Display VA is shifted so that the direct arrivals are aligned in time. spatial filter is applied to remove random noise and crossing wavefields. The data is filtered to match the bandwidth of the surface seismic data in the zone of interest. The data is presented at the scale(s) of the seismic data and at both polarities. Comparison of the downgoing wavefield with reflection occurring at the same depth on the seismic section at the well, will reveal any residual multiple activity on the seismic section associated with that particular reflector. For this exercise, the observed polarity of the reflection on the seismic section should be matched with the same polarity first arrival on the VSP downgoing wavefield; white trough matched to white trough or black peak to black peak. The downgoing wavefield can also be correlated with the upgoing wavefields in Displays VC and VD to establish the presence and origin of multiples within the VSP data. DISPLAY VG1 Interpreter's Composite (maximum bandwidth) This display is designed to show high resolution version of the VSP data for use in interpretation. All the data is therefore filtered using the 'maximum bandwidth' filter and is displayed at one of the seismic scales, and at both polarities, to allow direct comparison with the seismic section. This display contains : Enhanced, deconvolved upgoing wavefield, Transposed, deconvolved upgoing wavefield (see explanation) VSP - Borehole trace (see explanation) Borehole logs - linear time scale Borehole logs - linear depth scale Synthetic Seismogram (if available) Filter wavelet (spike convolved with filters applied to the upgoing wavefield after spiking deconvolution) Phase comparison wavelets (zero and minimum phase versions of final filters)Borehole Services Division Transposed Deconvolved Upgoing Wavefield EiSD/VSP/SSSID.2 The transposition of the deconvolved, upgoing data ensures that all primary reflections appear at true times and depths along the left (or right) hand edge of the display enabling easier comparison with the seismic section. The transposed display is obtained by producing number of output traces (typically 24) from number of corridor scans of the deconvolved upgoing wavefield as illustrated in Figure 2. Each trace is composed of series of small windows, one from each input trace, taken along the slope of the first arrival curve. The first scan on each trace is from the first arrival time to the time of the first arrival on the next (deeper) trace. Second and subsequent corridors are composed of series of windows parallel to the first arrival curve. The number of corridors is the same as the number of output traces requested. The last window for trace extends to the end of data on the deepest input trace; for output trace extends to the end of data on next deepest input trace and so on. Trace can be positioned at either the left of right edge of the display and both versions are always presented. Changes of dip, indicated by changes of AT from trace to trace on an event on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display are retained visually on this display, but the amount of AT between traces is altered slightly; any dip calculations should be made from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield only. VSP - Borehole Trace This trace, an estimate of the image at the borehole, is the most suitable single trace for comparison with the seismic section. A coherency filter is applied to the transposed data. single trace is selected from the resulting data and repeated several times.BSD/VSP/RG2.1 INPUT TRACE NUMBER: t 1st WINDOW FROM TRACE NUMBER: OUTPUT TRACE 2nd WINDOW FROM n-1 COMPOSITED TRACES 1st WINDOW 2nd WINDOW TWO WAY TIME Figure : DERIVATION OF TRANSPOSED DISPLAYDISPLAY VL1 Seismic Correlation Worksheet (zero phase seismic match) and DISPLAY VL2 Seismic Correlation Worksheet (minimum phase seismic match) BSD/VSP/SSSD2 These displays are designed specifically for comparison with the seismic section and are subset of the Interpreter's Composite Display. The data is filtered to match the seismic section. If the phase of the surface seismic data is unknown then both zero and minimum phase versions are produced. The displays are produced at seismic scale(s) and both polarities. The displays contain : Synthetic Seismogram convolved traces (if available)OPTIONAL SEISMIC SCALE DISPLAYS DISPLAY VJ Trace Inversion Composite BSD/VSP/OSSD2 Trace Inversion processing derives an estimate of the reflection coefficient sequence, and therefore the acoustic impedance log, from recorded seismic data. The VSP enables the incident wavelet (downgoing wavefield) and the reflected wavefield (upgoing wavefield) to be recorded at successive locations in the borehole. This allows an estimation to be made of the contribution of an interface in terms of reflected amplitude and thereby provides more precise determination of the reflectivity sequence than can be achieved from surface seismic surveys. The inversion procedure is based on the assumption of plane waves normally incident on horizontal interfaces. The bandlimited VSP trace is reduced to sparse-spike reflection coefficient sequence using structural deconvolution technique. The incident pulse is compared with the reflected wavefield and reflection coefficient series is estimated; velocity values are then derived from the reflection coefficient series. Seismic data is bandlimited due to the inability of geophones to record data accurately at low frequencies (below approximately 5Hz) and therefore low frequency trends need to be introduced during inversion processing. These trends can be obtained by applying low pass filter to smoothed velocity profile based on the well geophone first arrival times. The result is then combined with the high frequency data obtained from structural deconvolution. This display shows the input transposed VSP data before inversion, the resident wavelet used in structural deconvolution, the inverted single trace which most closely represents the borehole and the smoothed velocity profile. Additionally, if available, the calibrated velocity log is included for comparison. The presence of dip in the subsurface layers means that the basic assumption of plane waves normally incident on plane parallel layers is no longer valid Dip will affect the data in the following ways : (a) The partition of energy by reflection and transmission is changed (i.e. the reflection coefficient amplitude will not be the same as for the normally incident case assumed in the calculations) and mode conversion at formation boundaries will result in both compressional and shear components in the reflected and transmitted waves. (b) The reflection coefficients (and therefore acoustic impedance changes) derived from the VSP traces will occur at reflected times and not at the time at which the reflector in question intersects the borehole. For inverted data above T.D. of the well, the time of given reflector can be obtained from inspection of VSP display VF (dip angles can also be obtained from this data as described in the appendix to this report). For data below T.D., the angle of dip may be calculated from display VF and then the estimated time at which this event would intersect the T-D curve (and therefore the borehole) calculated by extrapolation.tiBorehole Services Division DISPLAY VK2 Kunetz Seismogram The Kunetz seismogram gives an estimate of the complete reflectivity sequence above the recorded VSP data. Based on the application of the energy-flux theorem (Dillon, 1991), this display is derived solely from VSP data and provides an approximation to the complete surface seismic reflectivity sequence; providing an image from the surface to the shallowest geophone station in the well. Autocorrelations are performed on the VSP up- and downgoing wavefields on trace by trace basis. The energy-flux is the difference between the downgoing wavefield autocorrelation and the upgoing wavefield autocorrelation. In practice, however, the downwave autocorrelation alone is reasonable approximation to the energy-flux. Every level recorded in the VSP gives an approximation to the theoretical energy-flux wavetrain from which the upgoing and downgoing surface seismogram estimates are derived. Deconvolution, using the downgoing surface seismic estimates, performed on the surface seismic upwave estimates, removes multiples that result from reflections off the free surface. Each trace in the VSP gives an estimate of the complete reflectivity sequence up to the surface; 24 (contiguous) representative traces have been chosen for inclusion in this display.

First Break, Vol 9, 289-298BSD/RIG/APP.1 Vertical well : Rig Source VSP APPENDIX Calculation of dip and offset of diffraction points from VSP data Calculation of the angle of dip The computation of the angle of dip is very straightforward, but involves making two assumptions: (1) The dipping reflector is planar, uniform surface. (2) The velocity of the material above the reflector can be regarded as constant. The first assumption is reasonably secure in regions of well behaved structure, and does not significantly affect the accuracy of the calculations. The second assumption may not be as reliable particularly in regions where there may be significant velocity changes in the near surface. If the dips are generally below 30, however, the errors introduced are again minimal; the basic consideration here is that the reflection points remain reasonably close to the well location. Even in areas of great structural variation and high dip, accurate calculations can be performed if geophone stations close to the reflector are chosen for the calculations. If one considers the two geophone stations in figure 1, it can be seen that an image point can be generated such that SO = 01 and SR = RI Where : S is the source I is the image point a is the angle of dip G1 is geophone G2 is geophone Figure Dipping reflectorBSD RIC,/ Ai . With the velocity considered constant, the lengths of the sides of the triangles can be expressed in terms of the respective arrival times such that: t, is the one-way first arrival time at G1 t, is the one-way first arrival time at G2 t, is the arrival time of the reflection from the dipping interface at G1 (equivalent to path G1-1) t4 is the arrival time of the reflection from the dipping interface at G2 (equivalent to path G2-1) t, is the travel time over the distance S-1 Using the cosine rule in triangle G1-G2-1, gives 2 t3 ( t1- t2 ) t24 cos(3- 2 t3 ( t1- t2 Hence the angle may be calculated. Using the cosine rule in triangle S-G1-1, gives = -2 ti t3c se Hence t, may be calculated Using the sine rule in triangle S-G1-1 gives Therefore the angle of dip is Method of calculation t3 ts sina sines a =sircl ( tsin0 ts To calculate the dip of any primary reflection observed on VSP data times t,, t2, t, and t4 are required. These values can be obtained from combination of the computation sheet (supplied with the Log Calibration report if available, or alternatively with the VSP report) and deconvolved upgoing wavefield display.Given dipping primary reflection observed on the deconvolved upgoing wavefield, choose pair of geophone traces to be used in the dip calculation. It is advisable that the estimate be made as close to the time-depth curve as possible as the At due to dip is at its greatest for any given geophone spacing when the geophone is closest to the reflector in question. t,: the one-way first arrival time at the deeper of the chosen geophone positions can be obtained from the computation sheet (corrected time, tc, at relevant depth). Alternatively, if the computation sheet is not available, the equivalent two-way time can be measured from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield display (time at time-depth curve on relevant trace) and halved; this method is, of course, less accurate. t2: the one-way first arrival time at the shallower of the chosen geophone positions. t3: the time of the arrival of the reflection from the dipping horizon in question at the deeper of the chosen geophone positions. This can be obtained from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield by measuring the two-way time to the reflection being examined, on the relevant trace, and subtracting the one-way first arrival time at the same geophone (i.e. t1). Similarly, t4: can be obtained from the deconvolved upgoing wavefield by the same process as t3, but using the shallower geophone trace. By substituting the values for these variables in the equations above, the angle of dip a, can be calculated. It is suggested that dip be calculated for number of geophone pairs to provide an indication of the scatter on the dip estimate. If the beds are not plane-dipping, then shorter segments of the reflector have to be used to determine the dip at any point, with an increased likelihood of error. Alternatively, the At can be smoothed by hand to give an average dip estimate. Note that the azimuth of dip cannot be calculated from this data. Calculation of the offset of the termination of dipping reflectors If the dipping reflection terminates within the data, it is possible to calculate the offset of the termination, hence inferring the offset of possible fault or turn over of the bed. As before, the calculation provides a reasonably accurate assessment of the size of the offset but no indication as to the azimuth. The assumptions made are the same as for the calculation of the angle of dip, and hence the same limitations will apply. If one considers figure 2, it can be quite easily (if tediously) shown that RP - (r-g) sin(2a) (2r-g) cosaWhere: RP is the distance along the dipping horizon to the termination of the event r is the depth of the geophone where the dipping horizon cuts the well g is the depth of the shallowest geophone for which the reflector has an expression Figure Offset of reflection point Calculation of the offset of diffraction points from the well Figure shows normal fault close to vertical borehole with diffraction points associated with the upper and lower discontinuities of the inclined bed. The diffraction points will scatter energy in both the S- and P-wave modes and these events may be detected by the array of geophone stations. The right hand panel of this figure, illustrates the ray propagation paths for either of the wave modes assuming a constant velocity profile. Figure illustrates the alignment of both P- and S-wave diffractions within the data. P-wave arrivals form event hyperbolae that are asymptotic to the first arrival curve in one direction and P-wave horizontal reflections in the other. S-wave diffractions display sharper curvature and in fact are asymptotic to the equivalent S-wavefields. It should be obvious from figures and 4, that the shortest travel path for the energy is that of direct p-wave propagation to the diffracting point followed by horizontal travel back from here to the geophone array. This means that the geophone that records the shortest time of the diffraction is positioned at the same depth as the diffracting point; the depth of the discontinuity can therefore be inferred by observing the apex of the hyperbola. The offset of discontinuity can be calculated quite simply by considering the diagram shown at the bottom of figure 4. If is the one-way first arrival time to the geophone level at the depth of the apex of the diffraction hyperbola. T is the travel time from source to diffraction point to geophone, i.e. the shortest travel time on the VSP display to the apex of the diffraction hyperbola. to is the horizontal travel time from the diffraction point to the geophone (unknown). va is the average velocity of the section between the source and the geophone. v, is the interval velocity (either P- or S-wave) between the diffraction point and the well.Borehole Services Division then by using pythagoras it can be inferred that ( tgva ) 4.
