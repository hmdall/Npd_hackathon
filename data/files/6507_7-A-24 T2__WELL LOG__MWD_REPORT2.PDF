Baker Hughes was present for the whole well. 5.1.2. DRILLING The section was drilled in Bit run. BHA # Interference from adjacent wells gave an initial 10 degree error on the MWD azimuth reading. As turn was required four Gyros were taken until MWD flagging had disappeared. Steering was easy with 70 degrees reactive torque. When boulders were drilled penetration reduced and some hanging noticed. Stalling occurred during drilling these boulders. In rotary mode the well originally dropped -then held and thereafter built. No clear pattern was seen. Azimuth response was also variable. Cone / nose area on the Bit was completely worn out. This hole was then successfully opened up to 24 and casing run and cemented. Drill cement plug, cement from 1646m to 1651m with high torque and very low ROP. Changed parameters frequently with no improvement. Drag up and down, with stalling/packing off. Cone / nose area on the Bit was completely worn out. Again very poor progress. Could not pass 1650m. Bit badly worn. POOH to section mill from 1480-1520m cement and sidetrack.A  24 T2 BHA # 11 (Slick rotary with milled tooth bit) Drilled out CMT from 1550  1571m- without problems BHA # 12 (Kick off Assy with RR milled tooth bit and Andergauge Stab) (1571m  2338m) Time drilled from 1571 to 1660m (100% Formation after 90 !! ) with Tool Face 60 to 90 and continued as per corrected directional plan, with slight left turn before swinging back to original wellpath again. Drilling was easy and steering was feasible at all times. 20m of sliding resulted in 2/30m DLS. Rotary behaviour however was not as one would have wished. Although the Andergauge adjustable stabiliser was set in minimum (15 7/8) position, the BHA dropped  1.0/30m. Frequent steering intervals as corrective measure were needed because of this. Drilled to 2338 m, and tripped out in order to change to Lyng PDC Bit. BHA # 13 (Kick off Assembly with Lyng PDC bit) (2338m  2364m) Drilled from 2338 to 2364 m, had technical problem with either gearbox or flexi brake on DDM- tripped out to shoe and then decided to pull out of hole, in order to repair the DDM. After the DDM was repaired, the same BHA was run back in hole. The assembly showed the same dropping tendency  1.0/30m although the Andergauge adjustable stabiliser was set in the minimum (15 7/8) position. To avoid too much steering, the WOB was increased to approx.10 tons and that resulted in slight build tendency. It also gave high ROP of up to 100 m/hr, and each stand had to be reamed twice to obtain the necessary hole cleaning. At 3147m the hole packed off while reaming, and the circulation was lost. Three hours were spent staging up pumps and circulating before drilling could continue. Only four steering intervals of 20m were necessary to stay on plan, 20m steering gave 2.8/30m dogleg. The Andergauge was set in minimum position most of the run except for one short interval were it was set in full gauge position (17 1/4) to drop inclination. With 4500lpm pressure difference of 16 bars between settings was observed. As the hole started to pack off at connections and parameters in general became more erratic it was decided to carry on rotary drilling, although the inclination dropped to 56 towards TD. BHA # 16 Run and cemented the 13 3/8 at 3358m. gyro run was performed in the 13 3/8 casing and that result lifted the TVD 4.2m upwards. Tagged the float at 3320m and drilled shoetrack with steerforce zero down to 3856m. There were no signs of cement above the float. Downlinked to Ribs off and drilled rathole. The hole tended to pack off there and one had to clean these very carefully. of new formation were drilled before pulling back into shoe and performing an F.I.T. to SG. Continued drilling tangent of 60 inclination down to 3503mand started to build to 72 inclination. buildforce of 45% was initially applied. However it was soon discovered that this was not enough to meet the required 3/30m DLS and downlink was sent to increase the build force to 65%. Yet another tangent section followed. By the time the wellplan asked for building and turning to the final inclination and direction, high temperature in the Top Drive were measured and drilling had to be interrupted for maintenance. The BHA was pulled into the casing shoe. In the meantime the geological department had revised their interpretations and new wellplan was submitted. That required 4.5/30m DLS. Back on bottom (hole in reasonable condition) downlink was sent with the appropriate parameters. The AutoTrak responded immediately and the well could be drilled according to plan. After reaching the landout, it was decided to extend the casing point to get the casing halfway into the re1.17 formation. Towards the end of the section more and more stringers had to be penetrated. Slightly more ruthless parameters were necessary in order to make any progress at all. But apart from occasional high stickslip values the downhole equipment showed no signs of fatigue. The AutoTrak showed very consistent behaviour and the Dogleg gradient varied between and with being the theoretical gradient. BHA # 17 This section was drilled in one run. Drilled out the shoetrack and rathole from 4027m to 4082m in drilling hours. Very good ROP drilling this section with an average of m/hr and instantaneous of 40  60 m/hr. Had some stringers in the upper part of this section with the thickest one from 4722 to 4729m. Due to the fast drilling we accumulated cuttings in the annulus and had to circulate once to lower the ECD. TD the well at 5240m. When pulling out of the hole we started taking weight at 5080m so it was decided to pump / backream out to the shoe. The bit was graded to   chipped teeth.

Main lithologies: The Shetland Group is subdivided into three formations, where the uppermost Springar Formation is the only one present in this well. The base of Springar is Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU). The Shetland Group is primarily made up of claystone with stringers of limestone. The Springar formation consists mainly of claystone. Stringers are found throughout the interval. Limestone stringers in the upper and middle parts, and thin stringers of dolomite in the lower part. Close to the base the claystone was interbedded with slightly dolomitic marl. Claystone: The claystone was predominantly olive grey and greyish green in the upper and middle part. The cuttings were firm to moderately hard, occasionally brittle, and had blocky to subblocky shape. In the middle part the claystone was also soluble to soft, occasionally sticky and amorphous. The upper part was moderately calcareous and non silty, and the middle and lower part occasionally silty and slightly to none calcareous. Traces of micropyrite and glauconite were observed in the upper and middle parts. In the lower part the claystone was predominantly dark grey with trace of micropyrite, and did not contain glauconite. Instead there were rare amounts of carbonaceous material. Limestone: The limestone was white to medium grey and occasionally light olive grey, firm to moderately hard and brittle. The cuttings were blocky to subblocky. The limestone was microcrystalline and slightly argillaceous. Dolomite: The dolomite was pale to moderately yellowish brown, moderately hard and the cuttings had blocky shape.

The final surveys are calculated using Baker Hughes INTEQ PC-RAW program. PC-RAW is software package for use on any computer connected via real time computer link to standard BHI surface system providing commercial Directional-RAW (D-RAW) service. The PC-RAW processed data is corrected for magnetic drill string interference, where our algorithm MAGCORR #1 HZ corrects the readings for axial magnetic interference. The SAG programme calculates the bottom hole assembly sag (or flexure), and how it affects the directional measurements. The program outputs an ASCII file containing table of inclination and correction values. This file is read by the PC-RAW program and the SAG correction can be applied automatically. The SAG program (version 1.10) will calculate the BHA sag based on two dimensional (2-D) input. The program output has been tested versus the more complex 3-D version, and found to calculate SAG correction with acceptable accuracy. SAG correction is applied on all BHI MWD runs, providing the inclination is above degrees. No gravity correction has been performed. SURVEY REPORTS: Various directional data listings are included: 1) General MWD Survey Information This is listing of the job specific data, such as customer information, well information, general correction information. The mnemonics used in this listing are listed below: Mnemonic Description DIPN Nominal local value for total magnetic dip angle HTN Nominal local value for total magnetic field strength GTN Nominal local value for total gravitational field strength Note that the survey rounding is toggled to ON. This implies that the inclinations and azimuths on the Final Survey Listing(s) are rounded to nearest 1/10 of degree. All other listings are rounded to 1/100 of degree. Although the displayed resolution of all surveys is to the nearest 1/10 or 1/100 of degree, internal resolution of all numbers and calculations is carried out using double precision floating point numbers. Appendix2) Full Survey Listing This is listing containing all relevant data about every survey. This list is primarily targeted at survey experts in BHI and the oil company, and is used for quality control and trouble shooting.

The Z-components point in the direction of the drill string. Also listed is the calculated GTB, G-Total-Base, which is the root mean square of the gravitometer readings. Theoretically GTB should be exactly equal to the nominal local value for the total gravitational field strength, GTN. Similarly, the calculated HTB, H-Total-Base, should read the same as the nominal local value for total magnetic field strength, HTN, if no drill string interference were present. An asterisk (*) for the quality flags for GTB and HTB value indicates that these values are deviating from the nominal values by gravity and gauss, respectively. An asterisk in the GTB-QF column indicates an erratic survey, i.e. the calculated GTB is out with 0.003 gravity of the nominal gravitational field strength. This can be due to drill string vibration, movement of the drill pipe when the directional survey measurements are acquired, or sensor related problem. An asterisk in the HTB-QF column does not necessarily mean that the survey is not valid, because this data has not been run through the PC-RAW program yet. On the contrary, the asterisk indicates that these surveys have to be corrected using PC-RAW algorithm in order to achieve reliable results. After correction, the HT (total magnetic field) value should be closer to the nominal value, HTN (the rejection criterion is deviation of gauss), than before correction. If the difference is larger than the criteria, the measurements are erratic or external (non-drill string) interference could have been present. This is indicated on the listing by an asterisk in the HT-QF column. Our axial magnetic drill string correction algorithm is called MAGCORR #1 HZ, and uses the BGGM (Global Geomagnetic Model from British Geological Survey) values of Earths Magnetic Dip Angle (DIPN) and Earths Total Magnetic Field Strength (HTN) to compute new value of HZ. This value is then used in the survey calculations instead of the transmitted base value HZBX. The algorithm has singularity for INCBS=90 and AZM=90 (or 270), and because of the uncertainty in DIPN and HTN the uncertainty of this correction increases rapidly when this angle is approached. Due to this the MAGCORR #1 HZ algorithm is usually not used when INCBS>60and AZM is in the corridor of due east/west < 30. In this situation Non-Magnetic spacing is used to minimise the drill string interference, and the base value HZBX is used in the final surveys. The sag corrected inclination (INCBS) and Final Grid azimuth (AZGC) of this listing is used for calculation of the wellbore position. 3) DIRECTIONAL SURVEY CALCULATIONS This is listing of the posted corrected surveys, with wellbore position calculations using minimum curvature method included.Formulas used to calculate values in the listings: Gravitation: 1) GTB = GXBX + GYBX + GZBX GT = GTB 2) GTB - GTN > gravity  GTB-QF set Inclination:  GXBX GYBX 2 +  3) INCB = arctan    GZBX  4) INCBS = INCB + SAG Magnetic: 5) HZO = HZBZ - HZ 6) HTB = HXBX + HYBX + HZBX HX = HXBX HY = HYBX 7) HTB - HTN > gauss  HTB-QF set 8) HT = HX + HY + HZ 9) HT - HTN > gauss  HT-QF set 10) DIPB - DIPN > degree  DIPB-QF set 11) DIP - DIPN > degree  DIP-QF set Toolface: 12) HTF = arctan  GXBX   GYBX  HXBX HYBX ( + 180 if GYBX is positive)Azimuth:  GXBX GYBX GZBX HYBX GXBX HXBX GYBX 2 + + * ( *  * )  14) AZMB = arctan  HZBX * (GXBX GYBX GZBX HXBX GXBX HYBX GYBX  + )  * ( * + * )  GX GY GZ HY GX HX GY 15) AZMC = arctan  HZ GX GY GZ HX GX HY GY (  * + 2) *( * + * ) 16) AZMO = AZMB - AZMC 17) AZGB = AZMB + ACOR 18) AZGC= AZMC+ ACORStatoil,Slot #24 Heidrun TLP,6507/7 HEIDRUN,Norway SURVEY LISTING Page Wellbore: A-24 Wellpath: A-24 Definitive (TD@1706) Date Printed: 1-Nov-2002 Wellbore Name Created Last Revised Well Name Government ID Last Revised 6507/7-A-24 Slot Name Grid Northing Grid Easting Latitude Longitude North East Installation Name Easting Northing Coord System Name North Alignment Heidrun TLP 421635,6960 7245988,6360 ED50-UTM-32N on EUROPEAN DATUM 1950 datum Grid Field Created By Comments All data is in Metres unless otherwise stated Coordinates are from Installation MD's are from Rig and TVD's are from Rig ( Heidrun TLP (RT) 74.2m above Mean Sea Level ) Vertical Section is from 6,05N 12,44E on azimuth 346,23 degrees Bottom hole distance is 696,59 Metres on azimuth 20,39 degrees from Wellhead Calculation method uses Minimum Curvature method Prepared by BHIWellpath Report MD[m] Inc[deg] Dir[deg] TVD[m] North[m] East[m] Dogleg [deg/30m] Vertical Section[m]Hole Sections Diameter [in] Start MD[m] Start TVD[m] Start North[m] Start East[m] End MD[m] End TVD[m] End North[m] Start East[m] Wellbore Casings Name Top MD[m] Top TVD[m] Top North[m] Top East[m] Shoe MD[m] Shoe TVD[m] Shoe North[m] Shoe East[m] WellboreWellpath (Grid & Lat/Long) Report MD[m] Inc[deg] Dir[deg] TVD[m] Northing[] Easting[] Latitude Longitude Vertical Section[m]Errors start at Mudline/Ground Level (419,80) Ellipses reported at confidence limit of 95,00%.
