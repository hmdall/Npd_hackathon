The work is covered by contract Nr 4100P13080 and Call-Off Order No. 4210003331, dated 17 March 2015. The core plug samples were received on January 2015. During the execution of the lab analysis PanTerra was in contact with Total in Pau to discuss results and quality control.

Total E&P Norge AS, Core Study Report of Samples from Well 34/6-3 (Garantiana-2)  Page 12 of 19Observations:  Sample No. has low permeability, due to low permeability layer perpendicular to the sample axis (see image below). The flush cleaning part was not further continued. Instead the sample was placed into the soxhlet apparatus for further cleaning followed by drying at 150 C, grain volume and grain density measurements. Figure - Photo of Sample No.  Sample 11, we could not measure four point Klinkenberg permeability. At higher Pmeans, we obtained slightly higher apparent permeability, instead of an expected lower gas permeability. This sample has somewhat low permeability (brine permeability is mD), and we believe that the drying by day nitrogen flowing was not enough to fully dry this sample. Some liquid was still in place during the single phase Klinkenberg permeability measurement. Thus at the higher injection pressure (Pmean) some of the liquid is displaced leading to slight increase in permeability. For Darcy Law to be valid for Klinkenberg permeability measurement, it demands that only one phase is present.  Sample No. 37 has too high Formation Factor (FF) value. It is also an outlier on the porosity versus FF x- plot. We suspect that the sample was not fully cleaned and some residual (non- conductive) crude oil was still present in the pores. Indeed, during the brine permeability stage small droplet of oil were observed on the collection tube. For petrophysical evaluation, we advise not to use the FF and porosity exponent m in the interpretation.  Sample No. 67 has visible fractured observed after the hot oven drying. Below is an image of that sample. Figure - Photo of Sample No. 67  Sample No. 71 has an apparent bedding around 45 degrees, which may explain the relative high porosity exponent of 2.32. The collected fluids and Dean Stark samples were shipped to Total Pau in week 37, 2015. PanTerra Geoconsultants B.V.

Total E&P Norge AS, Core Study Report of Samples from Well 34/6-3 (Garantiana-2)  Page 14 of 19On request of Miquel Bennes, four samples (1, 7, 11 and 22) were re-analysed for grain volume and grain density. In the table below are the initial (1st) measurements and the re-run (2nd measurement). The data of the 1st and 2nd measurements are comparable, and for calculation of porosity and porosity exponent, the results of the initial (first) measurements were used.

Sample No. is not following the trend on the above two plots (brine perm versus gas perm, and brine perm versus FF). This is pointed on the two plots by blue mark and omitted from the regression calculation). We received the ct-scan from Total in Pau, and it can be seen that the bedding of this sample is not parallel with the axis of the core plug (more like 45 degrees angle). This explains the low permeability of that sample. o  Sample No. 11 and 15 were fractured after unloading, and hence no mercury bulk volume could be measured.  Sample No. 22 already had visible (open) fracture at start of analysis and also for this sample we did not measure the mercury bulk volume.  Sample No. 36, 42 and 92 had visible, open fracture and only grain volume and grain density was Figure 12 - Sample No. 92 with Fracture, Sample No. 36 with Fracture and Sample No. 42 with Fractures PanTerra Geoconsultants B.V.
