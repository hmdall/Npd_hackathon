Job Summary 32 30 conductor casing The 36 hole was drilled to TD at 229 MD. The conductor was cemented from the shoe at 229 MD and back to the mudline at 154m MD. Prior to the job there was discussion on compressive strength development of conductor cement slurries. Several options were discussed, but the job was conducted with single 15.80ppg cement slurry. 200% excess volume was used. The cement slurry was displaced with 55bbls seawater at an average displacement rate of 5.7bpm. No problems were reported during the job. 20 13 3/8 casing A 17 1/2 hole was drilled to 1091 MD. The 20 13 3/8 casing was run to 1076 m MD and cemented by pumping 703bbls 13.2ppg lead slurry, and 159bbls 15.80ppg tail slurry. 100 % excess on open hole was used for volume calculations. The cement slurries were displaced with seawater at an average rate of 12.6bpm with the rig pumps. During the cement job there was trouble with the bulk system leading to stops in the cement delivery to the mixing unit several times during the job. Non-continuos cement delivery makes it difficult for the cementer to keep constant density on the cement slurry. Due to incorrect use of the cement head, the releasing dart did not go. Thus, the SSR top plug was never sheared and the cement was displaced without top wiper plug, leaving no barrier between the cement slurry and the displacement fluid (seawater). The casing was pressure tested to 1500psi (52 hours after the cement job). The pressure test was acceptable. In the following drill out phase, the cement was tagged at 1057 MD (11 below the float collar). The shoe / float collar was drilled out with rock bit with tons W.O.B. and 95 rpm (Drill out time = 1/2 hours). A LOT was performed to ppg after drilling out the shoe track.Plug across 13 3/8 shoe Well Report.. Cementing The objective of this job was to set balanced plug in the 13 3/8 shoe for sidetracking the well. The planned plug interval was 1244m MD to 1026m MD. The 13 3/8 tail slurry was utilized for the purpose. Since OBM was present in the well, 32bbls of Spacer-500E+ was pumped ahead of the 97bbls cement slurry. Load tested the plug after 20 hours. The top of the plug was verified at 1061 MD, lower than anticipated. Consider to use higher open hole excess volume on similar job in the future. No other problems reported. 9 5/8 production casing The 1/2 hole was drilled to 1890 MD and the 5/8 casing was run to 1875 m MD. The cement job was conducted by pumping 50bbls base oil, 50bbls 13.4ppg Spacer-500E+ ahead of 57 bbl cement slurry. 30 % OH excess was used in the volume calculations, with theoretical TOC = 1400 MD. Displaced the cement slurry with 9.5ppg brine. Pressure tested the casing to 5000psi 24 hours after the cement job. Pressure test acceptable. No problems reported.Plug and Abandonment of the Well: The well was abandoned by squeezing the perforations and setting additional plugs in the well. The PTA program implemented:  Squeezing the perforations through cement retainer and setting 100m plug on top of the cement retainer.  Setting 200m balanced plug inside the production casing where the casing crossed over into the 5/8 casing.  Isolating the 13 3/8 shoe with cement plug and cement retainer.  Setting 200m balanced surface plug. No problems were reported on any of the following jobs. Squeeze perforations and spot plug on top of retainer: An EZSV cement retainer was set at +/- 1625 m. The perforations (1 m) were closed by squeezing 15.80ppg cement slurry with moderate fluid loss properties through the retainer. 12 bbl of cement were squeezed into the formations and 14 bbl were left inside the casing below the retainer. Stung out of the retainer and set 100 balanced plug (12 bbl on top of the retainer, giving TOC at 1525 m. bbl of fresh water spacer was pumped ahead of and behind the cement slurry. An acceptable pressure test and load test was performed after cement had set (WOC time: hrs). Test pressure was 1000psi, the plug was then tagged at 1540 MD and load tested with 10 tons. Plug #2 (1 m): A 200 balanced plug was set inside the casing with TOC just below the 5/8 casing cutting point. The job was performed pumping 24.5bbls 16.0ppg cement slurry. Fresh water was used as spacer (5bbls ahead and bbl behind). Before pulling out of the hole, the brine in the well was displaced with 11.0ppg OBM (11.0ppg OBM remained behind the casing).Squeeze/plug #3: The casing was cut at 990 and cement job was necessary to isolate the 13 3/8 casing shoe. EZSV cement retainer was set at 887 m. 15 bbl of 13.4ppg Spacer- 500E+ was pumped ahead of 113.8bbl, 16.0ppg cement slurry. 14bbls of the slurry were squeezed into the formation below the 13 3/8 shoe. The remaining cement slurry was set as balanced plug above the cement retainer, giving TOC at 840 m. The plug was pressure tested to 110 bar after hrs WOC-time. The well was displaced back to seawater. Plug #4 ( m): A 200 balanced surface plug was set from m. The job was conducted by pumping 98 bbl 16.0ppg neat cement. The slurry was displaced with 7.5bbls seawater. The pipe was POOH to 185 and cement was reversed out.21`.Z.Cmii_gn Casing Depth, MD (m) 229 B.H.S.T. (C) 10 Casing Depth, TVD (m) 229 B.H.C.T.
