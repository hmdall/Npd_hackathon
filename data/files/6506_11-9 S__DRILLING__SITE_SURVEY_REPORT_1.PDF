Environmental Survey Strategy: The survey was conducted in order to satisfy Section 51 of The Activities Regulations, which states that habitat assessments should be undertaken prior to exploration in areas likely to contain particularly vulnerable environmental resources. Additional objectives of the survey were to determine the presence of Norwegian Red List species and relevant habitat types listed as threatened and / or in decline by the OSPAR Commission. Once the side scan sonar data and bathymetry data had been acquired, the seabed features were interpreted and all suspected coral areas mapped. Twenty-two camera transects and two drop-down stations were selected; focusing on the proposed Alternative and Alternative drilling locations, Alternative anchor positions and representative features throughout the remaining survey site. Digital still photographs and video footage were obtained from all planned transects / stations. Bathymetry: All water depths are referenced to Mean Sea Level (MSL). The seabed across the site presented an underlying slope of approximately 1 with water depths varying between 231.5 MSL in the northeast to MSL in the southwest, range of m. Locally, the seabed was highly irregular and rugged due to the presence of numerous iceberg ploughmarks. The iceberg ploughmarks generally trended from northeast to southwest with depths of up to compared to the surrounding seabed. Seabed Features: Seabed sediments across the survey site comprised veneer of very soft to soft, slightly sandy, occasionally gravelly clay with very soft to stiff slightly gravelly clay in areas. This was confirmed by photographic data acquired as part of the habitat investigation survey. Habitat Investigation: Numerous cold water corals were identified across the survey site, with the majority of these to the south and west of the proposed locations. There were typically 50 coral outcrops per square kilometre in the south-western part of the site. Occurrences of the Norwegian Red List coral species Lophelia pertusa were classified into five categories (gravel, dead, poor, moderate and good), whilst the sediment type encountered across the survey site was separated into two types (soft sediments and mixed sediments). Analysis of the side scan sonar indicated areas of low to medium-reflectivity soft sediments across the site which were confirmed by seabed photographs as silty sand andVulnerable Resources and Norwegian Red List Species: clay. Soft sediment was found to occur between iceberg ploughmarks and within the troughs of the ploughmarks. Mixed sediments with higher reflective sonar signature were identified along the flanks of iceberg ploughmarks indicating the presence of gravel, cobbles and boulders in conjunction with soft sediments. The epifaunal assemblage associated with soft sediments was of relatively low abundance and diversity. Mixed sediments were characterised by an increase in both epifaunal abundance and diversity. The increased coarse sediment component of this sediment type was associated with sponge assemblage, in addition to an increase in epifauna. Areas of coarse material were also colonised by the Norwegian Red List soft coral Paragorgia arborea, which occurred frequently sporadically throughout the survey site. The interpreted seabed features for the survey site revealed the presence of numerous possible coral mounds, for which confidence was high after the presence of Lophelia was confirmed at several mounds during ground-truthing. However, it was not possible to describe exactly what condition these interpreted coral reefs were in. No coral colonies were interpreted to be present within 100 of the proposed Cooper well location. The closest coral structure lay 118 south-southeast. The geophysical interpretation indicated that over 2200 possible coral reefs were present across the survey site, generally located on the flanks of iceberg ploughmarks. Of the total survey site 3% was determined to be coral habitat, 0.5% of which was calculated to comprise living Lophelia (i.e. classified as between poor and good quality) while the remaining 2.5% comprised dead coral or broken coral fragments (Lophelia gravel). Patches of Lophelia coral were considered to be more densely distributed in the southwest of the survey site, with fewer, generally smaller patches occurring in the northeast. In addition to the Norwegian Red List species Lophelia pertusa, the Norwegian Red List soft coral Paragorgia arborea was regularly recorded across the survey site, particularly in association with Lophelia structures. No other vulnerable environmental resource (as defined by Section 51 of The Activities Regulations), Norwegian Red List Species, or habitat / species considered threatened and / or in decline (under the OSPAR Commission) were recorded within the Cooper survey site.On the instructions of Centrica Energy, Fugro Survey Limited (FSLTD) performed geophysical, environmental and geotechnical rig site survey at Cooper in NOCS Block 6506/11. The survey was carried out between May 2011 and 14 June 2011 using the survey vessel M/V Fugro Meridian. The geophysical survey was required to provide seabed, sub-seabed, anchoring conditions and drilling hazard information for the emplacement and operation of semi-submersible rig within the Cooper Field. The environmental habitat survey was required to provide sufficient photographic data to describe and ground-truth all habitats recorded within the site by the acoustic survey, and to identify potential areas of coral habitat, particularly the hard coral, Lophelia pertusa. Any features of archaeological heritage, if encountered, were also to be investigated with the camera. The geotechnical survey was carried out to obtain detailed soil classification. The analogue survey area consisted of an km km grid for acquisition of single beam and multibeam echo sounder, side scan sonar, hull mounted pinger and mini sleeve gun data. The survey grid was extended during offshore operations; resulting in survey site of approximately km km. The digital survey area consisted of km km survey grid. The environmental survey was executed at the original proposed Cooper locations at Alt and Alt (see Table 1.1). However, subsequent to field operations, these proposed locations were abandoned and new proposed Cooper location was selected northeast of Alt by approximately km (see Table and Figure 1.1). Geodetic Datum ED50, UTM Zone 32N, Central Meridian 9E Location Latitude Longitude Easting [m] Northing [m] Seabed features and obstructions were interpreted from 120 kHz side scan sonar and multibeam echo sounder data. Sediment types were interpreted from acoustic character, background information and groundtruthing provided by the environmental and geotechnical surveys. The horizontal resolution of the side scan sonar data was approximately and obstructions smaller than this may not have been detected. The positional accuracy of features interpreted from the side scan sonar data depended on combination of the vessel positioning, acoustic positioning of the towfish relative to the vessel and interpretation of position relative to the towfish. For this dataset, the overall positional accuracy was estimated as  m.CENTRICA ENERGY RIG SITE SURVEY PL477, NOCS 6506/11 COOPER The environmental survey programme comprised habitat investigation involving the acquisition of seabed video and photographic data focusing on the proposed Alt1 and Alt drilling locations, Alt anchor positions and representative features throughout the remaining survey site (see Figure 1.2). The aim was to identify any potential sensitive habitats or species present within the survey site. The photographic data was acquired with frame mounted high-resolution digital stills Sonar Equipment Services (SES) camera. 1.3 Relevant Regulations and Legislation There are number of pieces of international and national legislation which are relevant to marine conservation in Norwegian waters, though Norway is not within the EU and does not, therefore, need to comply with the Habitats Directive and other EU legislation. The key pieces of legislation relevant to this survey include the following: - Duty to monitor and record data from the external environment according to Section 48 of the Framework Regulations, as specified in Chapter (Sections 52 to 59) of the Norwegian Activities Regulations (Petroleum Safety Authority, 2011), particularly the surveying of vulnerable environmental resources (defined by Section 53 of the Activities Regulations), which includes coral reefs, spawning grounds and Norwegian Red List species (Kls et al, 2010). The Norwegian 2010 Red List contains 4599 species; - The Marine Resources Act (2008). The Marine Resources Act aims to ensure sustainable and economically profitable management of wild living marine resources and genetic material derived from them, while minimising impact upon non-target species; - The Nature Conservation Act (1970) aims to protect natural habitats and wild flora and fauna of Norway. 2700 km2 of Norways marine waters and 68 species (terrestrial and aquatic) are protected under this act; - The Wildlife Act (1981) was formed to protect the external environment from pollution and to reduce existing pollution, this applies to exploration for, recovery and exploitation of submarine natural resources on the continental shelf, including the cessation of such activities; - Habitats and species listed as threatened or declining by OSPAR (2010a). Norway has an international responsibility to safeguard representative selection of fjord and coastal areas of types that are not found anywhere else in the world; - The Bern Convention (1979) The aims of this Convention are to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats, especially those species and habitats whose conservation requires the cooperation of several states, and to promote such co-operation; - The Norwegian Water Management Regulations incorporate the EU Water Framework Directive into Norwegian law. The objective is to achieve good ecological and chemical status for all water bodies by 2021. The regulations apply to inland and coastal waters out to the baseline. Norway is also making management plans for the Norwegian jurisdictional areas of the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea (State of the Environment Norway, 2011). However The Water Management Regulations are not intended as tool for regulating harvesting of fish stocks or other marine resources, nor for regulating the aquaculture industry along the coast. FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 PageOther pieces of legislation relate to the protection of the marine environment; however these were not thought to be directly relevant to the specific proposed developments in the Cooper survey site: - Act Relating to Sea-Water Fisheries (1983). The harvesting of flora and fauna which is destructive of species that should be protected, and harvesting of flora and fauna which provide food for species that should be protected (under Chapter II); - New Regulation of Bottom Fishing in Norwegian Waters (to be implemented 01 September 2011) to identify and protect vulnerable marine species and vulnerable bottom habitats, including live corals and sponges. This regulation is based on the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas; - Nature Diversity Act (2009) an updated act to include regulations of the Nature Conservation Act (1970), with the addition of the designation of selected habitat types, even outside protected areas; plus the act introduces special category for marine protected areas. However it is understood that the Act is not applicable outside the 12 nautical mile limit (pers. comm. Gard Nybro-Nielsen, Ministry of the Environment). 1.4 Important and Sensitive Habitats Several potential sensitive habitats were considered to be relevant to the Cooper survey site. These were identified as potentially occurring in this area of the Norwegian Sea and were accordingly taken into consideration during analysis of the geophysical and photographic data (Table 1.2). Table 1.2: Summary of Important and Sensitive Species / Habitats Species / Habitat Legislation Description Designation / Status Lophelia pertusa Activities Regulations Coral reefs Particularly Vulnerable Environmental Resource OSPAR; List of Threatened and / or Declining Species and Habitats Lophelia pertusa Reefs; Coral Gardens Threatened and / or Declining Norwegian Red List Lophelia pertusa Near Threatened Paragorgia arborea OSPAR; List of Threatened and / or Declining Species and Habitats Coral Gardens Threatened and / or Declining Norwegian Red List Paragorgia arborea Near Threatened Deep-sea Sponges OSPAR; List of Threatened and / or Declining Species and Habitats Deep-sea Sponge Aggregations Threatened and / or Declining Sea-pens and burrowing megafauna OSPAR; List of Threatened and / or Declining Species and Habitats Sea-pens and Burrowing Megafauna Communities No designation in the Norwegian Sea Carbonate Mounds OSPAR; List of Threatened and / or Declining Species and Habitats Carbonate Mounds No designation in the Norwegian Sea Fish Spawning Grounds Activities Regulations Spawning Grounds Particularly Vulnerable Environmental Resource Of particular interest was the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa, which is known to be relatively abundant in this region of the Norwegian Sea. Lophelia is important as it is the only known reef- building coral in the area, and provides valuable habitat for many other species, some of which are also sensitive. Of all Norwegian marine habitat types, coral reefs are considered the most vulnerable. Between 30% and 50% of all coral reefs in Norwegian waters were found to have been damaged tosome extent, mostly by bottom trawling, according to the Royal Ministry of the Environment (2001 - 2002). This is particular concern given the slow growth rate of Lophelia pertusa, previous studies have determined linear growth rates of between mm and 25 mm per year in depth range of 200 to 350 (Roberts et al, 2009); this is comparable to the depth range of 230 to 365 at the Cooper site. Lophelia pertusa is considered Particularly Vulnerable Environmental Resource under the Activities Regulations, has been designated as threatened and / or in decline by the OSPAR Commission, and is classified as near threatened in the Norwegian Red List (Petroleum Safety Authority, 2011; OSPAR Commission, 2008; Kls, 2010; respectively). The OSPAR habitat Coral Gardens, is characterised by taxa in the other corals habitat specific to the purposes of this survey (see Section 3.3.3). Coral gardens are recognised as being threatened and / or declining in the Norwegian Sea. Of particular relevance are the hard-bottom coral gardens dominated by gorgonians described by the OSPAR Commission, (2008), which include the species Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis. Colonies of Paragorgia and Primnoa are often found growing in association with Lophelia pertusa. Paragorgia arborea is also designated as near threatened under the Norwegian Red List (Kls, 2010). The habitat Deep-Sea Sponge Aggregations (designated threatened and / or declining in the Norwegian Sea) occur on mixed sediments and hard surfaces associated with iceberg ploughmarks, in depths comparable to those present in the Cooper site. Sponges are known to inhabit similar physical environments as Lophelia pertusa and are often found together. High densities and diversities of sponge species can be found in sponge aggregations, and can comprise 90% of the biomass of benthic communities (OSPAR Commission, 2008). Several species of sponge, detailed in Table 1.3, are included in the Norwegian Red List Data from the Cooper Survey site was therefore assessed for the presence of sponge aggregations. The habitats Sea-pen and Burrowing Megafauna Communities and Carbonate Mounds are also included on the OSPAR list, however they are not considered threatened and / or declining in Region (OSPAR Commission, 2008). Table 1.3: Norwegian Red List Sponge Species (Porifera) Class Species Demospongiae (Spicule skeletons of protein, and/or silica) Halichondria glaberrima Halichondria diversispiculata Hymeniacedon fristedti Calcarea (Calcium carbonate skeleton) Clathrina jorunnae Leucandra elongate Leucilla echinus Note: there are no species from the Hexactinellida class (glass sponges) on the Norwegian Red List (Kls et. al, 2010) Fish spawning grounds are considered Particularly Vulnerable Environmental Resource under the Activities Regulations. Though the survey site is not located within any important spawning areas, Acona Wellpro (2011) identified the Haltenbanken spawning area to be susceptible to impacts from potential oil spills from PL477. This area is important to Arctic cod, Arctic saithe and herring. Acona Wellpro (2011) also identified Eggakanten, Specially Valuable Area, as being of importance given its relatively close proximity west of the Cooper site. Eggakanten is an area of the continental slope in the Norwegian Sea with high biological production and high biodiversity supported by important,nutrient-providing currents. The area is considered particularly important for coral communities and fish populations (Det Kongelige Miljverndepartement, 2008-2009; MAREANO, 2011). Submarine structures made by leaking gases (seeps or pockmarks) with methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) are noteworthy as they are protected by the EC Habitats Directive. However these habitats are not described under any legislation relevant to the Norwegian Sea and were not considered high priority during the current investigation for this reason.1.5 Coordinate Reference System Table 1.4: Project Geodetic and Projection Parameters Global Positioning System Geodetic Parameters (1) Datum: World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) Spheroid: World Geodetic System 1984 Semi major axis: = 378 Reciprocal Flattening: 1/f = 223 563 Local Geodetic Datum Parameters Datum: European Datum 1950 (ED50) North of 62 (7 Parameter) Spheroid: International 1924 Reciprocal Flattening: 1/f = 000 000 Datum Transformation Parameters from WGS84 to ED50 (2) Shift dX: +116.641 Rotation rX: +0.893 arc sec Scale Factor: +3.520 ppm Shift dY: +56.931 Rotation rY: +0.921 arc sec Shift dZ: +110.559 Rotation rZ: arc sec Project Projection Parameters Grid Projection: Universal Transverse Mercator, Northern Hemisphere UTM Zone: 32 Central Meridian: 9 00 00 East Latitude of Origin: 00 00 00 North False Easting: 500 000 False Northing: Scale factor on Central Meridian: Units: metre Notes: always uses WGS84 geodetic parameters as primary datum for any frame rotation used by the Fugro Starfix navigation software. 1) Fugro Starfix navigation software geodetic calculations. 2) This is the right-hand coordinateFigure 1.1: 3D Surfaces Plot Showing Bathymetry of Survey SiteFigure 1.2: Shaded Relief Plot Showing Camera Transects and Drop-down Stations FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 102. METHODS 2.1 Habitat Survey Procedures 2.1.1 Interpretation of Geophysical Data The side scan sonar data was thoroughly examined as each line was acquired in order to determine the presence and type of features present, and to gauge the general extent of any features of interest. Once 100% coverage of the Cooper survey site had been achieved the onboard environmental scientists were familiar with all facies present and confident as to which type should be investigated further, with particular focus on those thought to represent potential coral mounds. The side scan sonar data was then reviewed with preliminary bathymetric data to compare sonar features with topographic variations (see Error! Reference source not found.). Figure 2.1: Example Side Scan Sonar Signatures of Lophelia (See Figure for locations) A D E Distinct sonar data signatures were considered to correspond with the presence of the cold-water coral, Lophelia pertusa; which, according to the bathymetric data, occurred on the berms (sides) of iceberg ploughmarks (Figure 2.1); the distribution of these facies rarely appeared to be independent of iceberg ploughmarks. Iceberg ploughmarks were found to be prevalent throughout the site, and cold- water coral communities are known to favour the flanks of the ploughmarks due to the greater exposure to food-bearing water currents. Areas of coarse material were generally associated with the edges of the many iceberg plough marks, indicative of hard substratum suitable for colonisation by Lophelia pertusa. The mottled patches with shadowing in the sonar data were thought to indicate coral pinnacles, while the ellipsoidal forms of generally lower reflectivity were thought to correspond to older, degraded fringes of the coral mounds (Figure 2.1). All such facies within the Cooper site were delineated and mapped from the 100% side scan sonar mosaic, and later reviewed against mosaics composed of only even lines and only odd lines. The delineated areas were then reviewed and FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 11discussed with the onboard geophysicist and the Client representative to ensure the side scan sonar data had been interpreted appropriately and as accurately as possible (See Figure for example delineations, and Figure for the locations of these examples). All areas of potential coral were then mapped together with the original proposed drill locations (Alternative and Alternative 2), proposed anchor positions and the Alternative anchor chain pattern. A 500 radius was displayed for each proposed drill location, and 60 radius was placed over each Alternative anchor location in order to identify areas of potential coral that may occur close to the proposed developments. 500 radius is considered the appropriate zone of seabed that may be potentially and directly influenced by impacts from smothering and / or contamination during drilling, while the 60 radius zones around each proposed anchor location were placed on the advice of Acona Wellpro (personal communications), to determine any corals present which may be at risk from mechanical damage during anchor deployment. 2.1.2 Survey Strategy A total of 22 camera transects and stationary drop-down deployments were selected to ground-truth all sediments present and provide sufficient data to contrast with the delineated boundaries of the mapped areas of coral (Figure 2.2). All sampling was carried out as proposed. The transects were typically positioned to run parallel to or perpendicular to the sides of iceberg ploughmarks in order to adequately delineate potential coral aggregations; Figure displays the environmental ground- truthing transects overlaid on shaded relief plot for the survey site. Camera stations were prioritised according to proximity to the proposed development locations, in the following order:  500 radius of the originally proposed Alternative location: three transects and one drop down location were positioned over potential corals and different habitat types with 500 radius of proposed well Alternative 1, This was to aid assessment of the corals that may be within the area of influence from drill muds and cuttings; the exact extent of which may be later determined using flow models. Other habitats of interest were also covered by the proposed camera locations.  500 radius of the originally proposed Alternative location: four transects were positioned within 500 of proposed well Alternative for the same purposes as above.  60 radius of each Alternative anchor location (Anchor to Anchor inclusive): potential coral structures and habitat changes were to be investigated using transects within 60 radius of each of the proposed anchor locations for Alternative 1. Where no features were identified in the side scan data for these zones, the closest corals / habitat types outside the 60 zones were selected for camera investigation. The purpose of these transects was to identify any potential coral structures that may be impacted by the installation of the anchors.  The remaining transects and drop-down station were positioned over features which were interpreted as being potential corals; different habitat types; and depressions with high reflectivity centres. These features were selected in order to represent other features of similar side scan signatures across the survey site, so that habitat classification could be extrapolated across the site where features had not been ground-truthed.

Seabed photography was acquired using an SES deepwater high resolution digital stills camera system, and video camera. The camera systems were attached to subsea camera frame, complete with underwater strobe, four LED lamps and USBL beacon. The lamps, manual still photography, and video recording were controlled by use of topside control unit. Seabed video footage was displayed on monitor and recorded directly onto hard disk drive. video overlay superimposed navigation string from the ships reference point, showing the easting and northing coordinates of the camera. The survey location, station number and date were also displayed. See example video clips via hyperlinks in Table 2.2. 2.2 Seabed Photography Interpretation Methodology To characterise the seabed sediments and fauna within the survey site, detailed analysis of video and stills photography data was undertaken by experienced marine biologists / taxonomists. Each still photograph was classified according to the sediment type and any identifiable epifauna (surface-living animals) were recorded in detailed digital stills photograph log (Appendix B.2). Similarly, video data was reviewed, noting the locations of any observed changes in sediment type and / or associated faunal community (Appendix B.3). Particular attention was paid to any vulnerable environmental resources, as defined by Chapter of the Activities Regulations (Petroleum Safety Authority Website), and Norwegian Red List species. Details of relevant Norwegian Red List species are provided in Section 1.4. An in house classification system, modified from that proposed by Moen and Svenson (2004) has been used to more accurately describe the coral formations typically encountered in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. As such, reef structure is classified into five zones; Lophelia pertusa (gravel), Lophelia pertusa (dead), Lophelia pertusa (poor), Lophelia pertusa (moderate) and Lophelia pertusa (good). Areas of non-coral habitat are classified as either soft sediments or mixed sediments, while occurrences of corals other than Lophelia pertusa are classified as other corals. For the purpose of this survey colonies of other corals were numerically recorded along each camera transect (Appendix B.3; Figure to Figure 3.11). Table describes the eight classifications in greater detail and includes hyperlinks to example video clips. An example photograph of each classification is provided in Figure and Section 3.3. FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 15Table 2.2: Classification of Habitats Within the Survey Site Classification Description 1 Soft sediments Typical soft sediments. 2 Mixed sediments Areas of increased coarse substrate (gravel, pebble, cobble or boulder) often found on the flanks of iceberg ploughmarks. These areas serve as substrate for the attachment of epilithic fauna. 3 Other corals Typically gorgonian corals such as Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis which may be found associated with Lophelia reef or separately, attached to hard substrate. These were semi-quantitatively recorded along transects (Appendix B.3) 4a Lophelia  gravel Dead Lophelia rubble / gravel  typically found around areas of coral growth. 4b Lophelia  dead Dead coral colonies (NB these are on larger scale than Lophelia gravel areas and have some form of structure). No living colonies of Lophelia pertusa should be observed in these areas. 4c Lophelia  poor An area dominated mostly by dead coral colonies or mounds but with small patches of living Lophelia. 4d Lophelia - moderate Reefs containing both dead, and living, colonies or mounds of Lophelia. 4e Lophelia  good Apparently intact colonies or mounds of Lophelia pertusa. Note: Click on hyperlinks to view video example for each classification The unpublished document Guideline  Visual Mapping Using ROV (DNV, 2009) was used to determine thresholds for Lophelia  dead, poor, moderate and good. Figure 2.3: shows example photographs of these classifications from the Cooper survey. The classifications were then applied to all video footage and photographic stills and recorded in the logs (Appendix B.2 and B.3). The continuous logging tracks (fix every seconds) of the camera position was compiled for each camera transect and drop-down, and used to create classifications which could be displayed on the side scan sonar mosaic (see Figure to Figure 3.11). This allowed comparison between observed coral occurrences against interpreted sonar facies of coral, and informed on the accuracy of the coral area delineations. 2.3 Calculation of Lophelia Classification Summary Statistics In order to provide broad summary of the classifications and coral areas for the Cooper site, the following calculations were performed:  All coral classifications were calculated as percentages of transect distance [m] over coral only. The total distance of all coral classifications over each transect were used as 100%; soft sediment, mixed sediment and other corals were omitted from the calculation.  macro was used in Surfer to calculate the combined area of all coral patches. Note that Surfer was used to examine the side scan sonar data and create boundaries around all 2224 areas of interpreted Lophelia coral during the preliminary analysis.  Total areas for each coral classification could then be calculated for the entire Cooper survey area using the values provided by the above procedures.

RESULTS 3.1 Bathymetry The following text has been adapted for environmental purposes from the geophysical report (FSLTD/Report Number: 00604V1.2). Survey bathymetry is presented in Error! Reference source not found. and shaded relief map focused on the environmental locations and proposed development is displayed in Error! Reference source not found.. Water depths are referenced to Mean Sea Level (MSL), predicted and generated from the Atlas of Tides on the Shelves of the Norwegian and the Barents Sea. MSL is above LAT at this area. Depths ranged from min the northeast to in the west-southwest. The seabed within 100 of the proposed Cooper well location generally deepened to the west- southwest exhibiting gradients of <2 at the proposed location. local maximum gradient of 9 was observed associated with an iceberg ploughmark. Water depths within this area varied from to MSL, range of m. The seabed across the site presented an underlying slope of approximately 1 with water depths varying between MSL in the northeast to MSL in the west-southwest, range of 16.3 m. Locally, the seabed was highly irregular and rugged due to the presence of numerous iceberg ploughmarks. The iceberg ploughmarks generally trended from northeast to southwest with depths of up to compared to the surrounding seabed. Cold water corals, with heights of up to m, were associated with the iceberg ploughmarks growing along the flanks. Maximum gradients of 40 were found locally where these existed however the multibeam echosounder at this depth was unable to pick up much detail with such complex coral outcrops. 3.2 Seabed Features (FSLTD/Report Number: 00604V1.2). seabed features chart is presented in Appendix A.3 of Volume 1, while areas of cold-water coral are shown within this volume in Figure and Figure 3.12. Seabed sediments across the survey site were interpreted to comprise thin intermittent veneer of very soft to soft slightly sandy, occasionally gravelly CLAY (<0.1 thick) with areas of very soft to stiff slightly gravelly clays. Coarser material (cobbles / small boulders) occurred at the margins of some iceberg ploughmarks. Very loose silty, slightly gravelly SAND partially infilled some of the iceberg ploughmarks. This was confirmed by photographic data acquired as part of the habitat investigation survey. Numerous cold water corals were identified across the survey site, with the majority of these to the south and west of the proposed location (see Appendix A.3 of Volume 1). There were typically 50 coral outcrops per square kilometre in the south-western part of the site. The coral generally exhibited heights of less than but locally exhibited heights of up to m. Specific height measurements are shown on the Seabed Features chart as different coloured dots. The coral was found growing on FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 18the flanks of iceberg ploughmarks. Coral classification was carried out along the camera transects with the colour infills matching description of the coral, found in the chart legend. 3.3 Habitat Descriptions The seabed habitats have been classified using the available geophysical data in combination with the ground-truthing evidence. All seabed video footage and digital stills photographs were reviewed in detail. Detailed logs of the data obtained are provided in Appendix C. Occurrences of the Norwegian Red List species Lophelia pertusa were classified into five categories (gravel, dead, poor, moderate and good) in accordance with Table 2.2. Occurrences of the soft coral species Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis were assigned to the other corals category, whilst the sediment type encountered across the survey site was separated into two types (soft sediments and mixed sediments). Sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.8 provide brief description of each habitat, the associated fauna and the general distributions across the survey site. Further information on the distribution of habitats is provided in Section and details of habitat distribution in relation to the proposed development are provided in Section 3.4.2. Information on the sediment type and fauna evident on each still photograph and on the seabed video footage was used to classify the habitat. For the purposes of this report the European Nature Information Service (EUNIS) coding system was used for the classification of biotopes. This is marine biotope classification system for European waters that has been developed by the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity and the European Environmental Information Observation Network and is based on hierarchical analysis of habitat. Initially marine habitats are defined at eight broad levels, biological communities are then linked to these (at three lower levels) to produce biotope classification. Table 3.1: The EUNIS Biotope Classification Hierarchy Level Hierarchy Description Example Classification Name Example Classification Code 1 Environment Marine habitats 2 Broad Habitat Type Deep-sea bed A6 3 Habitat complex Deep-sea bioherms A6.6 4 Biotope complex Communities of deep-sea corals A6.61 5 Biotope Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs A6.611 3.3.1 Soft Sediments The soft sediment habitat comprised fine silty, slightly gravelly sand with sandy clay in areas, as described in the seabed features (Section 3.2). Soft sediment was typically observed in areas between iceberg ploughmarks and in the central sections within the ploughmarks. The deeper, offshore sediment biotopes are not described to the same level of detail as their shallower, more accessible counterparts and are currently in development by EUNIS, as more data is acquired. This habitat and its associated faunal assemblage may be described by the EUNIS biotopes A5.27 Deep circalittoral sand and A6.4 Deep-sea muddy sand, which comprise offshore (deep) circalittoral habitats with fine sands or non-cohesive muddy sands and include diverse range of polychaetes, amphipods, bivalves and echinoderms (EUNIS, 2011). FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 19The observed diversity throughout the soft sediments was not as high as the areas of mixed sediments or areas of coral substrate; faunal assemblages associated with soft sediments are known to be dominated by infauna, with reduced epifaunal component. The recorded epifauna comprised sea cucumbers (Parastichopus tremulus); various seastars (Asteroidea), particularly yellow seastars (Henricia sp.); the pencil sea urchin (Cidaris cidaris), sea urchins (Echinoidea); brittlestars (Ophiuroidea); various sponges (on occasional gravel and cobbles) including Phakellia sp. and the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas to lesser extent, also the stalked sponge (Stylocordyla borealis) was found on one occasion during Transect 4; green spoon worm (Bonellia viridis); squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); crabs (Decapoda); various fish, particularly the redfish (Sebastes sp.) and cod-like fish (Gadidae). Considerable numbers of Gadidae fish were often observed, many of which appeared to be feeding. Bioturbation, in the form of burrows, was recorded throughout the majority of soft sediment areas, indicating the presence of relatively large infauna, most likely shrimp (Caridea). An example photograph of the soft sediment habitat is provided in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Example Photograph of Soft Sediment (Trans_01) Krill 3.3.2 Mixed Sediments Laser points 15 cm apart Redfish, Sebastes sp. The mixed sediment habitat displayed similar characteristics to the soft sediment habitat, but encompassed coarser sediment fraction, consisting of patches of pebbles, cobbles and occasional glacial erratic boulders. The density of the coarse fraction was observed to vary across the habitat, showing wide spatial distribution and generally associated with the flanks of the iceberg ploughmarks. The distribution of coarse sediments in this region is commonly determined by glacial processes; ridges of lithic material were formed by the ploughing motion of icebergs through the seabed which were then infilled by fine sediment, whilst the scattered boulders are typically the result of glacial deposition. Identification of mixed sediment areas from side scan sonar data was reliable as FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 20CENTRICA ENERGY RIG SITE SURVEY PL477, NOCS 6506/11 COOPER the sonar signature was not distinctly more reflective than the soft sediments; note that the mixed sediment habitat composed of coarse material in association with soft sediment. Mixed sediment was highly interspersed with patches coral habitats, which require stable foundation of coarse substrate. Where transects crossed iceberg ploughmarks, soft sediment was usually observed in the trough of the ploughmark  between patches of mixed substrate. Mixed substrate was the most commonly encountered habitat, which reflects the targeted nature of the ground-truthing programme and does not necessarily reflect the true proportion of the habitat in the survey site. This habitat could only be tentatively matched to the EUNIS biotope A4.12 Sponge communities on deep circalittoral rock and also showed elements of the A6.62 Deep-sea sponge aggregations biotope. Mixed sediments were associated with an increase in faunal abundance due to an increase in substrate for epilithic attachment and refuge for motile species, though diversity did not increase greatly. The coarser sediment fractions within this habitat provided substrate suitable for colonisation by variety of encrusting and erect sponges (including Phakellia sp., Mycale lingua and the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas), which appeared to dominate the epifauna. The Red List gorgonian coral Paragorgia arborea, which typically associates with Lophelia structures, were twice observed in this habitat. Squat lobsters (Galatheidae); seastars (Henricia sp.); cushion stars; holothurian sea cucumbers (Parastichopus tremulus); pencil sea urchins (Cidaris cidaris); anemones (Actiniaria); squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); shrimp (Caridea); hermit crabs, (Paguroidea); green spoon worms (Bonellia viridis); polychaete tubeworms (Sabellidae); various fish, particularly the redfish (Sebastes sp.) and cod-like fish (Gadidae), and one sighting of the rabbitfish (Chimaeriformes) were also recorded. An example photograph of the mixed sediment habitat is provided in Figure 3.2. Figure 3.2: Example Photograph of Mixed Sediment (Alt1_Trans_01) Gadidae fish Spoon worm, Bonellia viridis Squat lobster, Galatheidae Blue sponge, Hymedesmia pauperta Sponge, Porifera FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 213.3.3 Other Corals The term other corals essentially refers to non-stony corals which do not form persistent reef-like structures; the other corals in this survey comprised the sea fans (Gorgonacea). total of 250 gorgonian coral colonies were recorded during the habitat investigation, which were typically associated with all five Lophelia habitats, particularly those classified as Lophelia - moderate and Lophelia - good; for this reason, gorgonian colonies have been displayed numerically on the classification plots in Figure to Figure 3.11. Two species of gorgonian were encountered, the Norwegian Red List bubblegum coral, Paragorgia arborea (Figure 3.3); and the sea fan Primnoa resedaeformis. On average corals were recorded per 100 of all transect classifications, while 15.4 corals per 100 of transect over Lophelia classifications. As mentioned in Section 3.3.2 only two occurrences of gorgonians were recorded on substrate other than Lophelia coral; gorgonians require secure, solid surface to grow from and Lophelia structures provide suitable foundation. It is noteworthy that Paragorgia arborea, which grows readily on Lophelia structures, was occasionally observed growing in mixed sediment and Lophelia  gravel habitats, while Primnoa resedaeformis was only ever observed within Lophelia  dead to Lophelia  good habitats; it appears Primnoa requires the more substantial base of the coral mound from which to grow. The EUNIS biotope classification which best explains the habitat within which gorgonian corals occur is A6.611 Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs for the general environment in the Norwegian sea, and the reef communities, while the biotope A5.631 Circalittoral (Lophelia pertusa) reefs provides further detail on the association of gorgonians with Lophelia. The macrofauna associated with the gorgonians were also relevant to the Lophelia coral habitats; which is discussed further in Sections 3.3.4 to 3.3.8. Figure 3.3: Example Photograph of Other Corals and Lophelia  Dead (Trans_05) giant file clam, Acesta excavata Gorgonian coral, Paragorgia arborea FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 223.3.4 Lophelia  Gravel This habitat was best described by the EUNIS biotope A6.22 Deep-sea biogenic gravels (shells, coral debris), however very little detail was provided as this biotope is still under development (EUNIS, 2011). The Lophelia pertusa gravel habitat comprised fine silty sand sediment with mixed component of lithic (of rock origin) gravel and cobbles. This was overlain by coral debris in the form of L. pertusa gravel; with the density and coverage of the coral gravel varying across the habitat. From the data obtained, the distribution of the habitat generally appeared to be limited to the flanks of the iceberg ploughmarks, where the sediment type was typically seen to grade from the mixed sediment habitat to L. pertusa gravel, and was often in close proximity to Lophelia dead habitat. The Lophelia gravel habitat was often found to be in proximity of the higher quality Lophelia classifications, however it was also occasionally recorded in areas not considered to be obvious iceberg ploughmarks, and outside of delineated areas of coral interpreted from the geophysical data. The distribution of Lophelia gravel was predictable to some extent, as it generally coincided with areas of slightly lighter sonar reflectivity on the higher reflective flanks of iceberg ploughmarks, and often surrounded elevated coral mounds. However the sonar reflectivity of Lophelia gravel was very similar to that of mixed sediment and it was therefore not possible to distinguish between the sonar signatures of the two habitats when they occurred together. A similar epifauna was associated with the Lophelia gravel habitat to that of the mixed sediment habitat, with encrusting / colonial fauna dominating the species identified. Characterising fauna included various sponges (Porifera; specifically Phakellia sp, Mycale lingua, the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas); the green spoon worm (Bonellia viridis), squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); sea cucumber (Parastichopus tremulus); pencil sea urchins (Cidaris cidaris); anemones (Actiniaria); polychaete worms; various fish including redfish (Sebastes sp.); and infrequent colonies of the Norwegian Red List gorgonian, Paragorgia arborea. An example photograph of the L. pertusa gravel habitat is provided in Figure 3.4. FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 23Figure 3.4: Example Photograph of Lophelia - Gravel (Alt1_Anch1_Trans) 3.3.5 Lophelia  Dead The dead L. pertusa habitat comprised large fragments of dead L. pertusa and dead L. pertusa reef structures (see Figure 3.5). The distribution of the habitat appeared to be linked to the distribution of the Lophelia pertusa gravel habitat, which typically appeared to grade into Lophelia reef where present; aggregations usually indicate either proximity to live coral reef or first stages of establishing a reef (Freiwald et al., 2004). As such the spatial distribution of the dead Lophelia habitat was generally limited to the flanks of ploughmarks, where exposed hard substrate was present. This habitat classification was encountered on 43 occasions throughout the survey. This habitat was best described by the EUNIS biotope A6.611 Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs, however little detail was provided as this biotope is still under development (EUNIS, 2011). The species present within the habitat was similar to that observed within the mixed sediment habitat and the Lophelia gravel habitat, comprising mainly encrusting and colonial species such as cold water coral specimens (Primnoa resedaeformis and Paragorgia arborea) and various sponges (Porifera; specifically Phakellia sp, Mycale lingua, the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas; among others). The encrusting fauna present, particularly the gorgonians, were notably larger and more numerous than those observed in the aforementioned mixed sediment and Lophelia gravel habitats. It is likely that the increased density of hard substrate for attachment and the greater stability of this hard substrate facilitated the growth of larger specimens of attached fauna. The gorgonian Primnoa resedaeformis was recorded only on the coral habitats of Lophelia  dead to Lophelia - good; this species appeared FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 24to be dependant on the reef structure as no photographic stills or video data showed this sea fan occurring in the soft sediment, mixed sediment or Lophelia  gravel habitats. Other observed taxa included the pencil sea urchin (Cidaris cidaris; white sea urchin (Echinoidea); the yellow seastar (Henricia sp.) the seastars Porania sp. and Hippasteria phrygiana, including others; brittlestar (Ophiuroidea); squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); two anemone (Actiniaria) species; green spoon worm (Bonellia viridis); tubeworms (Polychaeta); the giant file clam (Acesta excavata); and various fish including the Redfish (Sebastes sp.) and cod-like fish (Gadidae). Figure 3.5: Example Photograph of Lophelia  Dead (Trans_05) Tubeworm, Sabellidae Redfish, Sebastes sp. 3.3.6 Lophelia  Poor This habitat relates to the EUNIS biotope A6.611 Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs. The Lophelia poor habitat was similar to that of the Lophelia dead habitat comprising largely dead L. pertusa reef structures, but differed in that small, sporadic colonies of living L. pertusa were present. Other characterising fauna included sponges (Porifera) and gorgonian colonies (P. arborea and P. resedaeformis); the epifaunal community recorded within this habitat was identical to that detailed in the Lophelia  dead habitat. This classification was encountered at 28 points across the survey site See Figure for an example photograph of the Lophelia  poor habitat. FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 25Figure 3.6: Example Photograph of Lophelia  Poor (Drop_01) Primnoa resedaeformis Pencil urchin, Cidaris cidaris Cushion star, Porania sp. 3.3.7 Lophelia  Moderate Hard coral, Lophelia pertusa Within the Lophelia - moderate habitat frequent, but small patchy colonies of L. pertusa were recorded in areas of predominantly dead coral. This habitat was generally associated with the more substantial coral structures. Again, other characterising fauna were sponges (Porifera) and the gorgonians P. arborea and P. resedaeformis. The moderate L. pertusa habitat was encountered on 21 occasions (see Figure 3.7). 3.3.8 Lophelia  Good Lophelia - good (i.e. apparently intact colonies or mounds of living L. pertusa approaching diameter) was recorded at 14 locations in the Cooper site. Again the epifaunal community was comparable to that observed with the other Lophelia habitats. The largest Paragorgia arborea colonies were found to be growing in association with this habitat (see Figure 3.8). Further information is provided in Section 3.4.

Distribution plots of the habitats have been created to display habitat classifications along transects for selected number of stations (see Figure to Figure 3.11). In addition an overview plot has been created displaying the occurrence of coral mounds across the Cooper survey site, interpreted from the geophysical data (Figure 3.12). Delineated patches of interpreted coral were found to occur in higher densities in the south-western half of the Cooper site (approximately 50 per km2), with considerably fewer patches in the region north-east of the proposed development (see Figure which shows general pattern of coral distribution). The abundance of coral patches was highly dependant on the spatial distribution of iceberg ploughmarks, the flanks of which typically comprise mixed / coarse sediment and provide suitable, elevated conditions for the growth of Lophelia structures. This area was unusual in that iceberg ploughmarks were located in the deeper section of the survey site and less so in the shallower area, whereas ploughmarks are usually absent in deeper waters where the seabed is below the reach of icebergs. The total distance of combined camera transects carried out in the survey site was just over km, of which 25% (1.6 km) was classified as Lophelia  gravel to Lophelia  good. Of the Lophelia habitats encountered, 70.7% were classified as gravel; 12.0% as dead; 8.2% poor; 5.5% moderate; and 3.5% as good. The delineated areas of coral interpreted from the geophysical data amounted to combined area of km2, of the total survey site of 52 km2. Therefore, by extrapolating the classification proportions for all delineated areas in the Cooper site, 3% was considered Lophelia habitat, ranging from gravel classification to good classification. Using the ground-truthed transects and the total areas of interpreted coral, the areas of each classification were calculated (see Table 3.2). Lophelia  good was predicted to cover 0.11% of the Cooper site, while Lophelia  gravel, the largest proportion, was expected to comprise 2.13% of the site. Note: the calculations used to extrapolate Lophelia classifications across all patches may have overestimated the areas, as the ground-truthing revealed the delineated coral patches to comprise some mixed sediment habitat; there were changes in sediment at fine scale within the interpreted facies that could not be completely resolved. Table 3.2: Summary of Lophelia Habitat Lophelia Classification Length transect over coral [m2] Ground-truthed coral patches [%] Area of all delineated coral in site [m2] Proportion of whole site area [%] FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 313.4.2 Proposed Development and Habitat Distribution Camera transects and drop-down stations were undertaken across areas of potential coral aggregations and features of interest identified in the side scan sonar data. Documented sediments were highly heterogeneous; all eight habitat classifications were recorded and distribution was strongly influenced by the distribution of iceberg ploughmarks. Soft sediments were generally found within the troughs of the ploughmarks and between ploughmarks, while mixed sediment was limited to the berms of the ploughmarks and general elevated features. (see Figure to Figure 3.11). 3.4.2.1 Coral Aggregations within the 500 Zone of the Proposed Cooper Well Location One camera transect was performed within the 500 zone of the proposed Cooper well location, Alt1_Anch4_Trans. The sediments documented along this transect comprised predominantly mixed sediments of sand with gravel and some pebbles and boulders, although an area of Lophelia gravel was also evident. No live hard or soft corals were encountered along transect Alt1_Anch4_Trans. No coral colonies were interpreted to be present within 100 of the proposed Cooper well location. The closest potential coral feature was considered to lay 118 south-southeast. Coral was interpreted to be present at number of discrete locations within 500 radius of the proposed Cooper well. The majority of coral colonies were present along the edge of an iceberg plough mark running west-southwest to east-northeast, and passing south of the proposed well location. Additional coral colonies were interpreted to occur further away from the proposed well Cooper well location, toward the west and south-southwest edges of the 500 zone. 3.4.2.2 Other Seabed Features Numerous depressions were identified throughout the survey site, most of which exhibited high side scan sonar reflectivity centres. High reflectivity centres can sometimes indicate the presence of methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC), which occur in sediments where hydrocarbons are actively released. Two depressions with high reflective centres were investigated during camera operations, one in the central region of the survey site (Alt1_Drop_01) and one to the south-east of the survey site, at Transect 07. The high reflectivity at both depressions was found to relate to the presence of coarse, mixed sediment; soft sediment with substantial component of gravel and cobbles. No MDAC or gas release was apparent in the photographic data, and side scan data revealed no facies of gas-bubble plumes in the water column. The depressions were therefore considered to be heel marks, caused by icebergs vertically spinning in one place while in contact with the seabed.

Isolated boulders, thought to be glacially derived, were also identified across the survey site. Areas of soft sediment supported relatively low abundance and diversity of epifaunal taxa, while areas of mixed sediments and isolated boulders were associated with an apparently rich sponge assemblage, including Phakellia sp. None of the observed sponges were identified as sensitive species (i.e. on the Norwegian Red List), however, it should be noted that accurate identification of sponges from seabed photographs is difficult as many may only be identified to species level with acquired specimens. Lophelia pertusa coral structures were found to have broadly similar epifaunal community to that found in areas of mixed sediment, yet biodiversity was generally richer and abundances were substantially higher. A review of the geophysical survey data revealed the presence of potential Lophelia pertusa coral reefs on the berms of iceberg ploughmarks; 2224 patches of Lophelia coral were interpreted and delineated in total. However the habitats mixed sediment and Lophelia  gravel exhibited very similar side scan sonar facies, and for this reason the exact extent of many of the delineated patches could not be resolved; ground-truthing revealed the presence of mixed sediment habitat within delineated coral areas, and likewise Lophelia habitats were sometimes found to extend outside the interpreted boundaries, particularly the Lophelia  gravel habitat. Despite this limitation there was high confidence that all coral areas had been identified, and areas had been reasonably judged. Areas of coral were considered to be present in higher densities in the south-western region of the Cooper site compared to the north-eastern part of the area; this pattern was considered to directly reflect the spatial distribution of iceberg ploughmarks. In total 3% of the total survey site was determined to be coral habitat, 0.5% of which was calculated to comprise living Lophelia. All eight habitat classifications detailed from Section 3.3.1 to Section 3.3.8 were recorded during the current survey. Some form of Lophelia habitat was recorded at 21 of the 24 camera transects / stations (i.e. minimum of Lophelia  gravel classification), while 15 of the 24 camera transects / stations recorded living Lophelia (i.e. Lophelia  poor to Lophelia  good classification). Note: Lophelia habitat was not expected at all camera locations; some areas were selected to ground-truth the general sediment conditions or other seabed features in the site, such as depressions. In total 44 interpreted and delineated coral patches were investigated with the deep- water camera, and all were confirmed as coral habitat, with the exception of one small patch located approximately 1600 southeast of the proposed well location. total of 250 gorgonian coral colonies (other corals habitat) were encountered in the Cooper survey site during camera operations; all identified as Primnoa resedaeformis and the Norwegian Red List species Paragorgia arborea. Eighteen of the 24 camera transects / stations recorded gorgonian corals. On average gorgonian colonies were recorded per 100 of camera transect over areas of Lophelia habitat. Depressions with high reflectivity centres were frequently identified throughout the geophysical data, however these features were thought to be heel marks caused by the spinning of icebergs on the FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 34vertical axis. review of photographic data showed no evidence of methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) or gas bubbles, and the geophysical data showed no features relating to gas- release in the water column, indicating the depressions were not seeps or pockmarks created by hydrocarbon release. A number of important habitats were considered to be of relevance for the Cooper survey site. variety of sponge species were found throughout the survey site, with few individuals being quite sizable, however the observed densities were not considered substantial enough to be identified under the deep-sea sponge aggregations habitat; which is recognised by the OSPAR Commission as threatened and/or in decline, and considered particularly vulnerable environmental resource by the Norwegian authorities. No evidence was found to suggest other particularly vulnerable environmental resources / habitats threatened and/or in decline were present, including sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities; glass sponges; and soft bottom coral gardens. Furthermore, review of the mapped particularly vulnerable environmental resources in relation to the location of the Cooper site showed no such habitats to have previously been recorded in the area (MAREANO, 2011). Characteristic elements of hard bottom coral gardens were observed however, specifically gorgonian corals including Primnoa resedaeformis and the Norwegian Red List species Paragorgia arborea. No known fish spawning grounds were located in the survey site, and photographic data showed no evidence of such features, however Acona Wellpro (2011) identified spawning ground southwest of the survey site. number of Specially Valuable Areas were identified within the Norwegian Sea, of which Eggakanten was found to be the most proximal to the Cooper site; Eggakanten is the area of continental slope considered particularly important for coral communities and fish populations (Det Kongelige Miljverndepartement, 2008-2009).

SERVICE WARRANTYSERVICE WARRANTY 1. This report and the environmental interpretation and assessment carried out in connection with the report (together the Services) were compiled and carried out by Fugro Survey Limited for Centrica Energy (the Client) in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Services were performed by Fugro Survey Limited with the skill and care ordinarily exercised by reasonable geophysical survey contractor, at the time the Services were performed. Further, and in particular, the Services were performed by Fugro Survey Limited taking into account the limits of the scope of works required by the Client, the time scale involved and the resources, including financial and manpower resources, agreed between Fugro Survey Limited and the Client. 2. Other than that expressly contained in the contract and in paragraph above, Fugro Survey Limited provides no other representation or warranty whether express or implied, in relation to the Services. 3. The Services were performed by Fugro Survey Limited exclusively for the purposes of the Client. Fugro Survey Limited is not aware of any interest of or reliance by any party other than the Client in or on the Services. Unless stated in the contract or report for the Services or expressly provided in writing, Fugro Survey Limited does not authorise, consent or condone any party other than the Client relying upon the services. Should this report or any part of this report or otherwise details of the Services or any part of the services be made known to any such party and such party relies thereon that party does so wholly at its own and sole risk and Fugro Survey Limited disclaims any liability to such parties. Any such party would be well advised to seek independent advice from competent geophysical survey contractor/consultant and/or lawyer. 4. It is Fugro Survey Limiteds understanding that this report is to be used for the purpose described in Section - Introduction and Scope of Work of the report. That purpose was significant factor in determining the scope and level of the Services. Should the purpose for which the report is used, or the Clients proposed development or activity change, this report may no longer be valid and any further use of or reliance upon the report in those circumstances by the Client without Fugro Survey Limiteds review and advice shall be at the Clients sole and own risk. Should Fugro Survey Limited be requested to review the report after the date hereof, Fugro Survey Limited shall be entitled to additional payment at the then existing rates or such other terms as agreed between Fugro Survey Limited and the Client. 5. The passage of time may result in man-made and/or natural changes in site conditions and changes in regulatory or other legal provisions, technology or economic conditions which could render the report inaccurate or unreliable. The information and conclusions contained in this report should not be relied upon if any such changes have taken place and in any event after period not greater than two years (or typically six months in the case of seabed features information) from the date of this report or as stated in the report without the written advice of Fugro Survey Limited. In the absence of such written advice from Fugro Survey Limited, reliance on the report after the specified time period shall be at the Clients own and sole risk. Should Fugro Survey Limited be asked to review the report after the specified time period, Fugro Survey Limited shall be entitled to additional payment at the then existing rate or such other terms as may be agreed upon between Fugro Survey Limited and the Client. 6. The observations and conclusions described in this report are based solely upon the Services which were provided pursuant to the agreement between the Client and Fugro Survey Limited. Fugro Survey Limited has not performed any observations, investigations, studies or testing not specifically set out or required by the contract between the Client and Fugro Survey Limited. Fugro Survey Limited is not liable for the existence of any condition, the discovery of which would require performance of services not otherwise contained in the Services. 7. Where the Services have involved the use of any information provided by third parties or the Client and upon which Fugro Survey Limited was reasonably entitled to rely then the Services clearly are limited by the accuracy of such information. Unless otherwise stated, Fugro Survey Limited was not authorised and did not attempt to verify independently the accuracy or completeness of information, documentation or materials received from the Client or third parties, including laboratories and information services, during the performance of the services. Fugro Survey Limited is not liable for any inaccurate information or conclusions, the discovery of which inaccuracies required the doing of any act including the gathering of any information which was not reasonably available to Fugro Survey Limited and including the doing of any independent investigation of the information provided to Fugro Survey Limited save as otherwise provided in terms of the contract between the Client and Fugro Survey Limited.
