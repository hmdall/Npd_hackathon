This is cold rig, and the rig has new rig consept namely the RAM RIG. This introduces many new operations to the rig personell. Sufficient procedures for all new operations must be established and continously revised until satisfactory. Use Safe Job Analysis (SJA) before performing new operation for the first time. Some challenges are identified:  Statoil procedures and requirements may be new to some personell onboard. It is emphasised that all leading personell must aquire sufficient knowledge of theese procedures/requirements before operations commence.  Operating new consept rig will surely introduce new operations to rig personell. Sufficient procedures for all new operations must be established and continously revised until satisfactory. Use SJA before performing new operations for the first time.  Syntetic Oil based mud will be used in the 12 1/4 section. Secure dump valves and other valves to sea. Never open or close valve without being 100% sure it is the correct valve.  36 and 26 hole section will be drilled riserless. If Cuttings Transport System (CTS) is used it will involve extra ROV operations and logistic needs.  Cuttings will be dumped overboard from the shale shakers. Drilling the 12 1/4 section will produce high amounts of cuttings and implies potential for spills. In case of oil spills or problems with handling of cuttings, inform driller immideately. Slow down pumping/drilling until handling of cuttings is satisfactory. 3.2 Quality For this well, special quality focus points will be:  All suppliers must check and test their equipment on the rig before start of operations.  All suppliers must also check interface with rig or other vendors equipment.  Establish good drilling practices and communication to avoid any quality-kill-situation: Stuck pipe, lost circulation, equipment downtime.Drilling Program 33/9-D-3 Sygna An experience report is to be written by the Ass. Drilling Supervisor for each hole section with focus on positive and negative experience. This report is to be controlled and signed by the Drilling Supervisor and sent to the Senior Drilling Supervisor and Lead Drilling Engineer. The report shall be saved in ESOP-SF-RESU-SAT database. As part of the contract, all service companies must use the QRS-system. The individual service company shall complete the PRS forms, and the forms shall be controlled and signed by the drilling supervisor. A list of the individual jobs and hole sections, for which PRS forms shall be completed are found in appendix (9.1) and electronically in ESOP-SF-RESU-SAT database. The drilling supervisor is resposible for updating the checklist in the ESOP database as PRS forms are handed in. PRS forms for all activities are found in BoB Extranet under Projects/QRS Table with service com lexibilit factor (SCF) above 12 1J4 Section Directional Drilling MWD (>200 circ. hrs) A Hazid has been performed for drilling D-3 in order to identify any potential hazards and susequent risk reducing measures to be implemented before the well is spudded. check list with actions taken can be found in ESOP SF-RESU-SAT database.

The three other wells from the D-template was drilled with no sign of shallow gas, and the area is classified as class according to Statoil classifcation system. 3 H2S No H2S has been identified in previously drilled wells in this area. 3 Riser margin and kick tolerance As per ICP-10 3 Potential drilling problems  The Balder formation consist of reactive clays and may cause hole instability problems. This has been experienced in several wells causing extensive backreaming. Pack off have been experienced in the 17 1/2 section, and the area around the Balder Fm. in particular. The Balder Formation has an estimated minimum fracture gradient of SG BMW, and the ECD may get close to the fracture gradient in pack-off situation. The hole cleaning must therefore be optimised at all times and it is recommended to circulate the hole clean for minimum one hour before drilling the Balder.  In the 17 1/2 hole section the inclination will be built from 15 to 65 at the end of the section. This implies lot of steering. It is important that the wellpath is kept according to the proposed plan. Poor hole cleaning may also be problem in this section, and therefore it is important to maximize the flowrate at all times and maintain high RPM on the string when rotating.  High focus should be kept on hole cleaning in the 12 1/4 hole section. This is very long 12 1/4 section with sail angle of 81.7. Plot off bottom torque and SPP and watch if any changes in trends. Circulate if any indications of bad hole cleaning.  drill pipe gyro will be run at approximately 6100m. Keep focus on not to get stuck.  Pefore penetrating the reservoir in the 12 1/4 section the inclination will be dropped to 60. Difficulties have been experienced dropping angle in this section.  Running and cementing the 5/8 casing is considered to be critical operation.Date STATOIL  Coal stringers in the reservoir are not predicted. However, if coal is present, it is considered possible lost circulation formations (estimated frac. pressure of SG).  Use of new suppliers and contracts: For drilling fluid, MWD and logging services new suppliers and new contracts will be used. Experience shows that this will create challenges in logistics, communication and working routines. Actions must be taken to ensure good communication in both planning and execution of the job.3319-D-3 4 Drilling 4.1 General drilling The 30 conductor and the 20 surface casing will be set at 363m MD RT / 363m TVD RT and 803m MD RT / 800m TVD RT. The 17 1/2 hole section will be drilled to below the Lista formation in order to seal off the sandlayers and potential loss zone in Balder at approximately 1700m TVD RT. A 12 1/4 hole will be drilled from the 13 3/8 casing shoe and through the reservoir to well TD at Particular emphasis should be put on the following issues:  Hole cleaning and stuck pipe. Do not hesitate to circulate hole clean if hole cleaning seems inadequate.  ECD: This is most important in the 17 1/2 hole after the Balder formation has been exposed, and in the 12 1/4 section when the reservoir has been penetrated. MWD pressure sub will be utilised during drilling of the 17 1/2 and 12 1/4 section. Data from the MWD shall be presented real time as EMW values in the drillers cabin and drilling supervisors office. As the formation strength data are obtained from LOT's and theoretical calculations, the actual downhole pressure data may not coincide accurately with these. It is therefore emphasized that the MWD pressure data should be considered as trends, rather than paying too much attention to the absolute value. Also note the variations in mudweight may cause the ECD data to oscillate significantly. Perform daily hydraulic calculations on the rig - and perform surge/swab analysis for reaming and casing running.  Steering the wellpath in the 17 1/2 and 12 1/4 sections.  Bring pumps up/down very slowly to avoid introducing unnecessary ECD peaks. Use only free pipe rotation prior to bringing pumps up. Increase rotation in steps after full circulation is obtained.  Ream shoetrack/rathole several times in order to reduce the probability of stuck pipe situations.  Stuck pipe.  Risk of getting stuck, drilling with high angle in most of the wellpath. In wells with high inclination hole cleaning might be challenge. Keep focus on hole cleaning not to get stuck.  Risk of getting stuck, running gyro inside the drillpipe at 6100m MD in the 12 1/4 section.Everyone has responsibility not to get STUCK. During the operations meeting onshore and offshore, focus on the risk of getting stuck. The driller has to be well informed about every possible problem that can take place, and which steps he immediately has to take. It is necessary to focus on good communication between everyone in the drilling team (driller, mud logger, mud engineer, MWD, drilling supervisor etc.) Reference is made to Stuck Pipe manual for:  Overview of causes of Stuck Pipe  Indicators of tight hole when tripping in  Indicators of tight hole when drilling  Indicators of tight hole when tripping out  Indicators available to the mud logger in analysing tight hole problem  The mudloggers response in the analysis of hole problem  Shaker evidence assosiated with hole problem Reference is made to Statoil Best Practice documents.4 Drilling 36 hole section 4 Operational guidelines 4 Drilling The 36 hole is planned to be drilled from seabed to 368m MD / 368m TVD +/-.

TOC is planned at 1592m TVD / 1763m MD, 400m over the 13 3/8 casing shoe. Measure the ID of 10 - 20 joint of casing and use the average measured ID in the displacement volume calculations. 1. Prepare tentative mixing and transfer pumping plan. 2. Make sure to aerate cement bulk tanks prior to cementing. Conduct prejob meeting with all involved personnel. 3. After landing the hanger, hook up the surface cementing/circulating lines on the rig floor. 4. Circulate and condition the mud until the well is clean and until the mud weight out is equal to the mud weight going in. The gas content should be maximum of %. Circulate minimum of bottom's up using the same pump rate as the planned displacement rate for the cement. Note: After the circulation period, it is important to avoid stopping the pumps unnecessarily. The circulation should only be stopped if necessary when dropping the ball and dart. 5. Pump spacer according to program. 6. Drop the ball for bottom wiper plug. 7. Start mixing the cement while pumping the spacer in such way that the slurry can be pumped directly behind the spacer. The mixing rate should not exceed 1000 l/min. 8. Displace the surface line volume from the cementing unit to rig floor with water. Leave 200 - 400 of slurry behind the plug. 9. Drop the dart for top wiper plug. 10. Displace the cement using the rig pumps. The cement pump should be used until the top plug has sheared. Before the spacer enters the annulus, the displacement rate should be as high as possible, without fracturing the weakest formation. Calculations of annulus friction pressure, ECD and U-tube/free fall - effect must be done prior to the job. It is important to have volume control from the start of mixing cement to the cement is in the place. 11. Decrease the displacement rate prior to bumping the plug. table containing number of strokes versus pump effieciency should be included in the procedure. Maximum allowed volume to be pumped should be stated prior to the job. 12. Bump the plug with 30-40 bar above the circulating pressure. Hold the pressure for few minutes. If steady, increase the pressure to the predetermined casing test pressure. 13. If the casing test is acceptable, bleed off the pressure slowly, and check if floats are holding. If floats are not holding, hold pressure until no bleed back occurs. Check pressure frequently so seal can be energized as soon as possible. If, after few hours, small pressure drop is observed, this can indicate the the cement is starting to set up.

Plan for Development and Operations, (1998). The field will be developed by means of two oil producers up flank and one water injector down flank. The operator recommends to drill Sygna Field water injector well 33/9-D-3 from the D-template on Statfjord Nord utilising slot number three. The well is scheduled to be drilled in year 2000 with the rig Borgland Dolphin. The recommended location for the 33/9-D-3 water injector was presented at the October 12, 1999 Advisory committee work meeting. The recommended solution is close to the PDO recommendation. The primary objective for well 33/9-D-3 is to give pressure support to the two oil producers planned on the field. Both the Etive and Rannoch Formations will be perforated to achieve necessary injectivity. The injector will be placed at the structurally lowest possible position in the western part of the field, in the down faulted segment close to well 33/9-19S, as far from and at equal distances to the two production wells. This will enable maximum sweep over the field. Well 33/9-D-3 is an extended reach drilling (ERD) well, drilled from the Statfjord Nord D-template. It is designed to penetrate the reservoir at 60 and reach total depth of 7285 mMD (2812 mTVD MSL), 107 mMD below base reservoir. Well 33/9-D-3 will be completed with vertical XMAS tree The expected cost of the well is estimated to 242 mill. NOK. The injector is necessary for development of the Sygna field. The PDO showed robust economical case with an expected NPV of 710 mill NOK (before tax, 15.15$/bbl.) Recommendation to drill Sygna Field well 33/9-D-3 Page of 191 Geological and geophysical interpretation 1.1 Introduction The Sygna Field is triangular structure dipping to the north-west, delineated by major faults to the south-west (F241) and north-west (F136) and an eroded Dunlin horst to the east (Attachment I). Exploration well 33/9-19 and the side-track 33/9-19 were drilled on the Sygna structure in the summer of 1996. Both wells proved oil in the Brent Group. The oil-water contact (OWC) was established at 2710 m MSL. The Brent Group in the Sygna Field only comprises the Etive and Rannoch Formations. The Ness and Broom Formations have not been deposited in this area, and the Tarbert Formation has been eroded. The Sygna Field will be developed by The water injector, well 33/9-D-3 H, will be drilled to give pressure support to the two oil producers planned on the field (33/9-N-1 and 33/9-N-3 H). It is designed to inject into the Etive and Rannoch Formations, thereby giving pressure support to both formations. The injector will be placed in the down faulted segment between faults F136 and F118 in the western area of the Field (Attachment I). This location will place the injector as far as possible from and at equal distances to the two oil producers. Fault interpretation of F136 and F118 and the sealing capacity of fault F118 are considered to be the major geological uncertainties with respect to planning of the water injector 33/9-D-3 H. fault seal analysis has been carried out on fault F118 to assess the communication across the fault. The conclusion from this study is that the Etive to Etive juxtaposition will very likely give an open fault. Cross-sections from the injector to the two producers are displayed in Attachments and VI where the formation juxtaposition across the fault F118 is illustrated. 1.2 Seismic interpretation and depth conversion The seismic interpretation of the Sygna Field has been performed on the ST97M3 seismic data set during 1997/1998. The data quality on and around the Sygna Field is generally good, although poorer along the north-eastern and north-western flanks of the structure. Structural depth maps have been made for the following horizons:  Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU/ top reservoir)  Top Rannoch Formation (lower Rannoch shale/ base reservoir)  Top Statfjord Formation The depth conversion method was based on stacking velocities down to the BCU and interval velocities from this level and down to the underlying horizons. The depth uncertainty at the BCU level over the down-faulted segment of the Sygna0 STATO Field is estimated to be +/- 10 at the injector well, and the corresponding uncertainty for Rannoch Fm. is estimated to be +30/-20 m. Target location description The Target at BCU is located at the structurally lowest possible position on the BCU in the western area of the field. The target is placed 150 from the major NE-SW trending fault F136 to the west and 100 from the NE-SW trending fault F118 to the east of the target (Attachment I). This is the most optimal injector location with respect to the two producers and also takes into consideration uncertainties discussed in Chapter 6. A structural cross-section along well path 33/9-D-3 is shown in Attachment III, and seismic random line along the well path is shown in Attachment IV. The injector will penetrate the BCU (/top Etive Fm) at 2650 +/- 10 mTVD MSL (6961 mMD), at the intersection between line 1254 and trace 10977 on the ST97M3 survey. The well will have an azimuth of 50.07 and dip of 60 at the BCU target, refer to Attachment VII for target location summary. The well will penetrate the top reservoir in the oil zone and cross the OWC (2710 mTVD MSL) at top Etive Fm level and reach total depth 107 mMD below base reservoir. This will provide rathole for dropping the TCP guns. The Etive Formation is estimated to be 69 mTVT (139 mMD) thick and the Rannoch Formation is estimated to be 57 mTVT (114 mMD) thick, refer to Table 1.1 for details. The degree of confidence is regarded as high, since the injector is placed in close proximity to the BCU penetration point in well 33/9-19 A. The predicted reservoir quality for the Etive and Rannoch Formations in well 33/9-D-3 is based on the results from well 33/9-19 (see Table 1.1). The CPI logs are included in Attachments IX and X.

Due to the complexity of the well, data acquisition is kept to minimum. All logging data will be gathered using MWD and, no wireline work is planned. A detailed formation evaluation and logging programme is outlined in Attachment Xt.2 Reservoir evaluation 2.1 General As described in the PDO, the Sygna Field will be developed with two producers and one water injector. The producers will be located as high as possible on the structure, and the water injector down flank as far as possible from the producers. Maximising the injectivity index is important. The chosen location for the injector on Sygna is optimised with respect to these criteria. 2.2 Well Location The producers on Sygna will be located up flank as close as possible to the fault F115, see attachment I. The well 33/9-N-1 will be located to the south of the injector and the second producer, 33/9-N-3 H, to the east of the injector. To maximise the oil-production from the field, the location of the injector is chosen as far as possible from the producers and at the same time inside Sygna's structure with a secure distance to the fault F136 to the north west. This location has almost the same distance to the producers, where the reservoir model predicts simultaneous water break through in both producers. 2.3 Injection Strategy The water injector 33/9-D-3 will be located at lateral distance of approximately 1000 to the north north-east of the producer 33/9-N-1 in down-faulted segment. The injector is designed to inject into both the Etive and Rannoch Formations, such that pressure support for production from both formations will be achieved. The injector will be perforated both in Rannoch and Etive Formations, and due to the reservoir properties of the zones, the major part of the injection is expected to flow into the Etive Formation. Calculated injectivity index when perforating both Rannoch and Etive Formations (from Rannoch to Etive 5) is 185 Sm3/d/bar. The injector is located in down thrown segment, reservoir zones in the down thrown segment will communicate across the fault to the south east (Fault F118) with shallower zones, see table and attachment V. As the best Etive zones from Etive 4 to Etive will be juxtaposition with Etive to Etive 5, most of the flow of injected water across the fault is expected to take place between these zones. Along the fault, the Etive Fm and shallower zones are expected to be in juxtaposition with the best Rannoch zone (Rannoch Fm 4). In this way some of the injection into Etive in the down thrown segment is expected to flow across the fault into the Rannoch Fm zone and contribute to the sweep of the Rannoch Formation. During production the reservoir pressure will be kept on the initial pressure level by balancing the production with the injection in the well 33/9-D-3 H. The secondproducer 33/9-N-3 is planned to be on stream December 2000, which will increase Sygna's production to 6000 Sm3/sd and the injection will be increased accordingly. 2.4 Pressure prognosis The pressure was measured to bar at Datum Depth (2685 TVD MSL) in July 1996 in the exploration well 33/9-19 S. This measured pressure is not expected to have been influenced by production from nearby fields after 1996. Formation Depth (mTVD MSL) Minimum** Expected and Maximum* Pressure (Bar) Pressure (Bar) Table 2.1. Pressure Prognosis * The expected and maximum pressure equal the pressure measured in the well 33/9-19S. **The minimum pressure is bars depleted below the expected pressure. Pressure gradient is bar/m in the oil zone down to OWC of 2710 TVD MSL. Below this depth the gradient is bar/m. 2.5 Injection profile Sygna's reservoir pressure will be kept close to the initial level during production. The water injector is planned to come on stream third Quarter 2000 and is estimated to have an initial injection rate of 3600 Sm3/sd. The second producer will produce from December same year, and the rate will be increased to 7200 Sm3/sd.

The RT level at Borgland Dolphin is 31 above the Mean Sea Level (MSL). The 30 conductor will be installed 60 +/- below seabed at 365 mTVD RT. The 20 casing will be set at 800 mTVD RT, to ensure sufficient integrity to drill the 17 1/2 hole with sufficient mud weight. A 17 1/2 hole will be drilled (from the 20 casing). The inclination of the well path will be built from 15 degrees at the 20 casing shoe to 65 degrees at the end of the 17 1/2 section. The direction of the well will be 50 degrees. The 13 3/8 casing will be installed at 1800 mTVD RT to seal off the Balder Formation. A 12 1/4 hole will then be drilled through the reservoir to well Total Depth (TD). The inclination will be built up to degrees below the 13 3/8 shoe. The inclination will then be dropped to 60 degrees before reaching the BCU target at 2681 mTVD RT. The inclination will then be held at 60 degrees through the reservoir to well TD, 2843 mTVD RT (7285 ml\ID). The 5/8 casing will be installed at 2838 mTVD RT. The drilling time estimate is 96 days for well 33/9-D-34 Completion Strategy The completion of injection well 33/9-D-3 will be performed during spring/summer 2000, using the rig Borgland Dolphin. The well will be completed using vertical X-mas tree (SSP). The tubing material will be carbon steel, with the following sizes: 5 1/2 tubing from tubing hanger to below the Tubing Retrievable Surface Controlled Subsurface Safety Valve (TRSCSSV). 7 production tubing from TRSCSSV to packer setting depth. 5 1/2 tubing from packer to end of tubing. The minimum inner diameter (ID) of the completion string will be in the TRSCSSV, which is 4.562. The production packer will be set in the 5/8 casing. The well will most likely be perforated with tubing conveyed perforating guns (TCP) in underbalance. Approximately 175 perforation interval is planned in Etive Fm and Rannoch Fm 4. Planned injection rate in the well is 7200 Sm3/D. back-up solution with perforation guns run on well tractor will be evaluated. An injection test will be considered if the quality of the formations prove poorer than expected. The completion time is estimated to 27 days.5 Well economics 5.1 Well cost The time estimates for drilling and completion are based on statistical data from Statfjord Nord and Statfjord Ost. The expected time for drilling of the well is 96 days and for completion is 27 days. The cost of the well has been calculated based on mill. NOK per drilling day and mill. NOK per completion day. An exchange rate of NOK/$ has been used. The expected total cost of the well is estimated to 242 mill. NOK. The well is planned to be drilled and completed with the rig Borgland Dolphin. In the cost estimate budget for Sygna an increase of up to 30% of operation time has been added for the operations the first months, The current drilling schedule this well be drilled later than this period and hence without any extra cost, however the drilling could commence earlier to achieve flexibility for start-up day and marine operations. For the well D-3 this could increase the time used for drilling by 24 days and the budget by 46 mill. NOK. The completion time could increase by days and the completion budget by 17 mill. NOK, adding up to total of 304 mill. NOK 5.2 Economic analysis The drilling and completion uncertainties have been evaluated. The spread in the expected time estimates is based on historical statistical data from Statfjord Nord and Statfjord Ost. The Low (P90), Expected (P50) and High (P10) values are given in Table 5.1. Rig Days P90 ' Expected (P50) P10 Drilling days 144 96 72 Completion days 40 27 17 Table Low, expected and high estimates for completion and drilling days An analysis of the drilling- and completion time has been performed. Low, Expected and High estimates for the total well cost have been established. The estimate is based on the spread of the time estimates, and the daily cost given in section 5.1. P90 Expected (P50) P10 Table Low, expected and high estimates for total well cost Evaluation of the value of this well is not strait forward since the well is an injector, and in fact the only injector on Sygna. The field would almost not produce without the injector since almost no pressure support from the small aquifer is expected. The Page 10 of 19Net Present Value (NPV) for the producer 33/9-N-1 includes the production from this well, so not to count volumes several times the NPV has been calculated based on third of the field's production. On the investment side only drilling and completion cost for the injector have been taken into account. The result is lift cost for the well of $/bbl. The NPV for the well for different oil prices are given in table Oil-Price 1$/bbl] 10 15,15 18 Net Present Value [milLNOIC991 738 243 522 Table Net Present Values for well 33/9-D-3 for different oil prices Recommendation to drill Sygna Field well 3319-D-3 Page 11 of 196 Uncertainty evaluation 6.1 Geological model and seismic interpretation Fault interpretation of F136 and F118 and the sealing capacity of fault F118 are considered to be the major geological uncertainties with respect to planning of the water injector 33/9-D-3 H, Attachment I. The seismic fault interpretation has been revised since the PDO was submitted. The penetration point of the Target at BCU has been chosen in secure distance to the F136 fault (150 m), as crossing this fault to the west would be detrimental to the purpose of the well. The Target at BCU lies 100 to the west of fault F118. There is low risk of penetrating the F118 fault in the lower part of Rannoch Fm, as the distance from the well path to the fault decreases when moving northwards. A qualitative fault displacement and fault seal analysis has been performed on fault F118. The degree of reservoir sand juxtaposition across the fault was constrained, and the sealing potential of the fault estimated. The key uncertainty in both evaluations is fault throw. sensitivity on the results of fault throw was assessed by evaluating two models for fault throw; Base case based on the current seismic interpretation of the fault throw, and Downside case where fault throw was approx. 15 (10 ms) greater, reflecting the maximum possible throw over the fault. The base case gives up to 40 Etive Fm 5-3 juxtaposed on itself and the downside case gives up to 20 Etive Fm 5-3. The fault is also open where Etive 5-3 is juxtaposed against Etive Fm 2-1 and Rannoch Fm 4-2, although with reduction in transmissibility, refer Table 6.1. The risk of fault seal (i.e. closed fault) is considered low where Etive to Etive Fm is juxtaposed in both models. For the Base case, Rannoch to Rannoch juxtaposition is also considered open, but with fault zone related reductions in permeability by up to factor of 10. summary of the study follows: i Formation juxtaposition Fault zone Fault zone do vvnthrown / upthrown Base case Downside case Etive 5-3 / Etive 5-3 open open Etive 5-3 / Etive 2-1 open open Etive 5-3 / Rannoch reduced reduced Etive 2-1 / Etive 2-1 open - reduced not present Etive 2-1 / Rannoch 4-2 reduced reduced Rannoch 4-2 / Rannoch 4-2 reduced possibly sealing Table Formation Juxtaposition is) refer to Table for formation description ii) None of Rannoch Formation 3-1 are to be injected Page 12 of 19The depth uncertainty to BCU is regarded as low, due to the close proximity of well 33/9-19 A. The Brent Group reservoir quality (see section 6.2) and isochores are therefore also expected to be similar to 33/9-19 A. 6.2 Reservoir quality The reservoir quality of the Etive and Rannoch Formation sandstones is predicted from the 33/9-19 well results. Abrupt changes in depositional facies controlling the reservoir quality are not expected. The Rannoch Formation is of rather heterogeneous character, and may exhibit more rapid lateral variations in reservoir quality. Overall, the reservoir quality is expected to be in the same range as observed in the exploration wells on the field. 6.3 Reservoir evaluation The reservoir model is relatively homogen and will be updated after obtaining the well results resulting in more inhomogeneous model. constant value for each reservoir zone for the reservoir properties have been implemented in the reservoir simulation model These are the average properties observed in the exploration wells 33/9-19S and -19A, see Table 1.1. The estimated time for water break through is during the second Quarter of year 2003 in the base case. It is estimated that, with 100% increase of the average permeability in the Etive Formation between the injector and producer, the time for water break through may come year earlier. This is due to more dominant Etive Formation override, and as result, the recovery of the Rannoch Formation reserves will decrease. As described in the PD01, several sensitivities regarding the permeability of Rannoch and Etive Formations have been performed. Due to the limited experience with production from the Rannoch Formation, the evaluation of the properties from this zone is uncertain. 25 % reduction in the Rannoch Formation permeability will reduce the field's recoverable reserves (to year end 2009) from mill. Sm3 to 7.1 mill. Sm3 and also results in water break through one year earlier. The fault seal analysis of fault F118, described in section 6.1, suggests reduction in transmissibility between the Etive Formation zones and in the downthrown segment, and the lower Etive and Rannoch Formations in the upthrown segment. This has been included in the base case reservoir simulation model. Included in the downside case simulation model is the additional possibility of having sealing fault where the Rannoch Formation zones 2-4 are juxtaposed across the fault. These scenarios have been modelled, and have only minor effect on the total flow across the fault. This is because the injected water will mainly flow across the fault between the Etive Formation zones 3, and with lesser flow from the Etive Formation zones 3-5 (downthrown) to Rannoch Formation (upthrown). Therefore, the possible sealing between the Rannoch Formation 4-2 juxtaposition will not alter the overall flow from the downthrown segment to the upthrown segment. A small pressure drop (0.3 bar) between Etive Fm and Rannoch Fm was observed in well 33/9-19 S. This potential barrier is expected to be broken during 1 PDO, Subsurface technology, Reference document to PDO, section 3, chapter Recommendation to drill Sygna Field well 33/9-D-3 Page 13 of 190 STATO production and injection. Even with vertical flow barrier, sensitivities show that only small changes in oil production volumes are expected. This is because the oil flow across this boundary is limited and the water injection will be redistributed to maintain balanced reservoir pressure in all layers. 6.4 Drilling The main uncertainty lies in the use of the Borgland Dolphin drilling rig. This is RAM rig type. A waiting on weather time of 14 days has been included in the drilling time estimate as the well will most likely be drilled during the winter season. The estimate is based on statistical data from this period of the year. The lower part of the 17 1/2 hole includes swelling clays and with possible loss zone in the Balder Formation. The properties of this formation is risk for the progress of the well, and may increase the drilling time. A risk is also identified when building an angle from 15 to 65 degrees in the 17 1/2 section. similar risk is identified when dropping the angle from sail angle of 81.7 to 60 degrees above the reservoir in the 12 1/4 section. In an extended reach well, hole cleaning may be problem. The importance of removing the drill cuttings from the well will be emphasised due to risk of getting stuck or 'pack-off with lost circulation. Running and cementing the long 5/8 casing is also considered to be critical operation. 6.5 Completion The completion design for well 33/9-D-3 is well proven and based on standard equipment. The major uncertainty is related to running the sub sea system including the vertical X-mas tree. Experience from earlier completions on Statfjord Nord and Ost will be implemented in order to minimise risk of down time related to subsea equipment. The importance of clean surface system and cleaning of the well will be emphasised, in order to minimise the risk of pre-setting the packer. The completion time estimate is related to experience gained on other Statoil operated fields where this X-mas three system is run. Injection The suggested perforation interval has been chosen to maximise the injectivity of the well. The major challenge is related to optimise the distribution of the injection on the Statfjord Nord D-template, as four wells with different injectivity and different reservoirs pressures will be operating with common manifold pressure.

ROV SystemsAl ABB Vetco Gray EQUIPMENT SPECIALTY CONNECTORS AND PIPE OPERATING AND SERVICE PROCEDURE 100 SQUNCH JOINT CONNECTORS TECHNICAL TOOL DESCRIPTION Squnch Joint Connectors are automatic lock, mechanical release connectors. They are pressure tight joints that do not require rotation for make up. Their most common use is for quick connection of large diameter conductor and casing in offshore drilling operations. There are two main types of Squnch Joint connectors. Type ST-2 and ST-2 HP Squnch Joints are standard-duty connectors designed to be run into pre-drilled holes or in conductor strings that are jetted in place. The ST-2 HP (High Performance) is available for applications where enhanced strength is needed. Type ALT-2 Squnch Joint is designed for medium to severe drilling conditions. It is joint that when properly maintained can be used on continued well-to-well program and can be driven to refusal without damage. ALT-2 Squnch Joint Connector REV.

Thoroughly clean the pin and box. Examine the o-rings and lockrings and replace any that are damaged. Ensure that the lockring is free to move in the lockring groove. If some joints will be recovered for re-use, run tap into each releasing screw hole and blow out any debris with rig air. Then liberally grease the threads in each releasing screw hole. NOTE: Lubricants containing metallic particles such as drillpipe thread dope must not be used on these connectors 2. Lightly grease the Squnch Joint pin profiles. 3. If the Squnch Joint pin is equipped with an anti-rotation key, ensure that the key is not damaged or loose. RUNNING PROCEDURE General Notes ABB Vetco Gray recommends that Squnch Joints are run box down. This method provides optimum resistance to damage when handling. Most Squnch Joints are equipped with round key on the pin and corresponding slot inside the box. hole drilled through to the outside indicates the location of the slot. Some Squnch Joints are not equipped with an antirotation key. To assist with releasing these connectors, locate the lockring gap and place paint mark on the pipe and/or the connector in line with the gap. To make up these connectors, simply position the box over the pin and slack off. If conductor or casing joints fitted with Squnch Joint connectors will be recovered and re-used, make certain the plastic plugs supplied with each box connector are fitted in the releasing screw holes after checking lockring make up, just before running.MUNCH JOINT CASING CONNECTORS Connectors of the same nominal size can be made-up together regardless of wall thickness, but caution should be exercised since in some cases the connector's inside diameter changes as result of the wall thickness variation. This could result in mismatch between the ID of the pin and the box, creating square shoulder which could provide hang-up point for equipment being run through it. Special transition Squnch Joint connectors can be provided for connecting different wall thickness pipe in the same string when connector ID varies. Procedure 1. With the joint of conductor or casing landed at the rotary table and the next joint suspended from the blocks, check the lockring groove in the box member to assure it is free of debris that may have lodged there while picking up the joint. Align gap in the lockring with the anti-rotation key on Squnch Joint pin. This will provide reference point for the lockring gap location and will assist in releasing connectors. 2. Rotate the suspended joint until the anti-rotation slot of the box connector lines up with the anti-rotation key on the pin connector. Lower the joint until the key enters the slot then slack off quickly to make up the connection. 3. Verify that the lockring is fully engaged in the lockring groove on the box member. This can be visually checked through the releasing screw holes on the box member, or by inserting depth gauge into the releasing screw holes. short piece of welding rod correctly marked can be used as depth gauge. POST-OPERATIONAL MAINTENANCE Maintenance will be necessary when Squnch Joints are recovered, normally after driving operations. 1. Wash the pin and box with fresh water. Examine the o-rings and lockrings, and replace any that are damaged. Ensure that the lockring is free to move in the lockring groove of the pin. 2. Clean the lockring groove on the box connector, and check that the lower edge retains square profile. This is particularly important where the Squnch Joint has been exposed to severe driving conditions. 3. Apply corrosion inhibitor to pin and box connector surfaces. Install protectors and place in storage on racks.SOUNCH JOINT CASING CONNECTORS RECOMMENDED SPARES Selection of actual quantities for spare parts should be determined by customer operating personnel. As rule of thumb, we offer the following suggestions. Rubber Goods General: 0-rings - replacements 1 replacement for any sub-assembly which if damaged or lost could cause rig down situation. DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCEDURE NOTE: It is good practice to first make up the releasing screws opposite the gap in the lockring, and then make up the other releasing screws from this point around to the gap. On connectors without an alignment key, the gap in the lockring can usually be located by referencing the paint mark applied at make up or by inserting piece of welding rod into the releasing holes on the box. DISASSEMBLY To Release Connectors The lockring can be depressed by screwing the releasing screws into the tapped holes provided. The releasing screws must be long enough to depress the lockring before the screw threads bottom on the connector. Run each releasing screw in until tight, then back off 1/2 turn. Pick up on the Squnch Joint box to disconnect the joint. Releasing Screw Requirements Connector Type Thread SizeASSEMBLY None required. TEST PROCEDURE Some Squnch Joint boxes are equipped with test port, and have o-ring seals above and below that port. After make up, maximum test pressure of 500 psi (35 bar) may be applied to the test port. At the completion of the pressure test, remove the pressure fitting and re-install the small pipe plug.IIIII =II Mil INN IIIIIII MIN IIIIII I I\ KeiGirrciki) A / T EE ORAV KS: N-01033 WI.
