DRILLING 36 Hole Section (359.5.0mMD seabed  426.5mMD) BHA # The section was drilled with 17 %2 used bit and 36 hole opener in one bit-run in total of 3.5bit hours and circulation hrs. Surveys showed inclinations up to 0.88. 24 Hole Section (426.5mMD  930mMD) Varying performance in the first part, but at the end, the motor gave up to /30m on full slide. Were not able to achieve the required DLS at the start of the section, needed to cut down flow in order to minimize formation wash-out. The section was drilled in one bit run, in total of hours on bit and circulation hours. The well was kicked off according to plan. The BHA respond was good throughout the entire run, theoretical dogleg capability of 5.2/30m. BHA # 3, AutoTrak RUN# A %2 AutoTrak was used for drilling the 17 %2 section. Cement was drilled from 891m down to 930m in 3.4 hours, the shoe-track and rat-hole was cleaned out and 3m of formation drilled before taking FIT to SG EQMW. Ribs-off was down-linked prior to drilling the shoe at @922m. The steering performance was very good for the first 400m of the build-up section, in the Green Clay formation, but deteriorated with depth in this formation. The rest of the section through the Balder, Sele and Lista, was drilled as tangent with no steering problems encountered. The BHA configuration worked well, but different bit may be consideration, as it was struggle to keep the ROP at desired level. The tool sent only zeroes from 2105m to 2125m, resulting in the tool operating in Ribs off mode. The assembly dropped deg in this interval, translating into deg/30 dogleg. The tool then worked fine until 2136m where it failed again so continued drilling to TD at 2187m in Ribs Off mode. The overall ROP was less than expected, and might relate to the high inclination of the well, with the section being drilled in total of drilling hours, giving an average ROP of m/hr. Section PageBHA # 4, AutoTrak RUN# Cement was drilled from 2136m down to 2179m and ribs off was down-linked prior to drilling the shoe at 2180m, after the down-linking high torque and high stick slip readings of and were persistent and difficult to counter. RPM and WOB were varied and the bit restarted but the stick slip remained problem. The shoe-track and rat-hole was cleaned out and 3m of formation drilled before taking FIT to 1.4SG. EQMW. The formation drilled was fairly hard resulting in low ROP. Steering control was good with slow steady sleeve rotation. At 2236m it was decided to activate the AnderReamer. By mistake the Andergauge engineer dropped the wrong size activation ball, 1/4 instead of 3/4, causing the pump pop offs to trip and subsequent flow and pressure readings indicated the ball was not seated and causing an obstruction somewhere in the string. POOH to change out AnderReamer, on surface the ball was found inside AnderReamer it could not pass through the 2 ID of the tool leading to the ball seating point. BHA # 5, AutoTrak RUN# The new Anderreamer was activated at measured depth of 2236m by the usual shear pin method and after drilling ahead the hole size was confirmed to be 13 1/2 by the MWD calliper. The initial part of the run was subject to high torque and stick-slip values, which were countered by varying WOB and RPM but were difficult to eradicate. ROP was not as high as anticipated with hard formation and stringers being encountered. The assembly performed well as regards steering with good response to changes in steering parameters aided by slow steady sleeve rotation. The Gas-Oil contact came in 7m earlier, TVD wise, than anticipated with the result the build rate was changed from 3.5m dogleg per 30m to degrees per 30m to compensate and raise the TVD of the landing point. The well was landed perfectly as regards both TVD and landing point. On landing at measured depth of 2864m the Troll Petek department onshore came with new plan to lower the TVD by 1m over the 100m section drilled for the ITBS system. There were no problems of any kind during this run associated with the AutoTrak or AnderReamer. There was pressure drop from 192bar to 160bar over 12 hours. On surface washout was found on the Smedvig X/Over between the float and Hevi-wate pipe, the pin connection on the Hevi-wate pipe was also damaged by the washout. BHA # 6, AutoTrak RUN# 4(2970mMD  2970mMD) Drilled out ML aluminium bushing, cement, float and casing shoe at 2968.8m. Experienced high torque and Stick Slip values while drilling out the drillable bushing. Tool stopped pulsing while drilled on drillable bushing according to memory data at 2909m.POOH at 2970m due to change ATK.BHA # 7, AutoTrak RUN# (2970mMD  4651mMD) The objectives for this section was to drill as per. geologist instruction from 2970m to 4860m. At 4860m turn the well from direction 132 deg Az. to 314 deg. Az. (180 deg. turn) with 3.9deg/30m DLS. The BHA behaviour was not constant, in section from 3200 to 3450m poor response in soft formation and from 4000m to 4200m.Twice switched to 100% steerforce and had to hold back ROP and strong left walk tendency was observed. Used more WF as expected witch created twice dogleg of on walk. Due to erratic steering performance NH decided to POOH, but at 2246m it was decided to run back and continue drilling. From 4500m had problems with decoding, lost lot of time due to troubleshooting, bad cont. drilling to 4651m.Then it was decided to POOH, and change the ATK. The tool was troubleshooted below the shoe one time without success. The very difficult behaviour during drilling of those two sections, was related due to bit being sensitive to formation. BHA # 8, AutoTrak RUN# (4651mMD 5888mMD) section TD Drilled as per geologist instruction from 4651m to 4864m on Az +/-131 deg, start 180deg turn at 4864m while drilling in calcite stringer. Planned DLS 3.9deg/30m to TD +/-6200m at 314 deg AZ.. The ATK functioned as expected but encountered very difficult drilling with the bit being to formation influence see BHA #7. In calcite stringers were forced down from 90+ to 88+ deg over short distance. We switched twice to 100% steer-force at -10 vector to be able to build. In hold mode 68%BF the ATK was not strong enough to break down formation resistance. Even while time drilling at 15m/hr with 100% force in steer-mode we observed drop. During 180 deg turn section was very difficult to establish deg DLS, had to used from -55WF to -85%WF and check survey every half stand. Dogleg range drilled from deg to deg per 30m based on turn rate. Hard calcite causes local doglegs and doglegs over deg/30m were reamed. The HCR607 PDC bit provided good ROP in both sand and calcite stringers. The TD for this section was shorter due to overlapping ellipses to the well L13 H. The well was turned from Az 131 deg to 357 deg with overall dogleg of deg/30m. 8 1/2 HOLE SECTION  Y2H BHA # 9, AutoTrak RUN#7 (2906mMD  5479mMD) The objective for this section was the same as for leg #1. Drill 0.0-0.5m above oil water contact. Based on result from leg#1 it looked like OWC was varying with TVD from surveys. Result from leg #1 was used as guide to drill leg#2. Drilling from whip-stock, planned to build well-path to 1589.7m TVD in m- sand and geosteer from this depth. A very long and good run. In the sand it was easy to maintain very high ROP with controlled NBI. Steering in the sand was no problem and the performance was higher than theoretical. However, one experienced that the tool was sensitive to formation changes and stringers with the result of HLD both for inclination and azimuth.The assembly was very sensitive to hard stringers, and some of this effect is probably caused by the lower Flex-Stabilizer in BHA. The decoding was poor when the flow was less than 1750LPM and impossible under 1600LPM right from the start of the run. The tool was supposed to be medium flow tool with flow range 1200- 2060LPM, but it behaved more like standard flow tool. From 5400m the BHA was pushed left and NBI pushed down to 89.5deg. Time-drilled and used 100% force in steer-mode to correct this, but at 5479m it was decided to give up and POOH to change bit. BHA # 10, AutoTrak RUN# (5479mMD  6077mMD) Changed out PDC bit for Rock-bit type MX-RS 18DDT. Drilled Calcite stringer from 5479m to 5496m after this only few small stringers was seen for the rest of the run. At measured depth of 5785m still drilling in good C sand new styrings notat from Petek was to extend the well with 200m, first 100m geosteering as per Geologist and last 100m to build up inclination with 4/30m dogleg to verify GOC. The steering performance was excellent and the BHA gave good response throughout the run. Drilling parameters were adjusted ongoing to stay within torque limits. The drilling was up to the limit of 45kNm at the end of the run. This run was done in bit hours with an ROP of 13.9m/Hour. If not for the stringer at the very start of the run, PDC bit would have done the job with less torque and higher ROP. 5.2 BHA and ParametersAdvantage BHA Performance Report ^ Operator Norsk Hydro Field Troll Location North Sea Hole Size 36 in Well 31/2-L-12 Rig West Venture Job # 60491690 ASU S/N BHA Description 36 hole BHA Run Parameters BHA Run # MTR Run # Distance P/U Date 22/mar/2003 13:00 ATK Run # MTR Rerun # Avg ROP ft/hr L/D Date 23/mar/2003 14:15 ATK Rerun # Max Temp degF MWD # MD In On Btm Circ hours Start Drilling 23/mar/2003 03:50 Bit # MD Out Off Btm Circ hours Stop Drilling 23/mar/2003 07:35 String Parameters # Component Mfr S/N Gauge OD in OD in ID in Fishing Neck in Length Total Length 15 Drill pipe 1/2 14 Sub - X/O RIG 13 RIG 5/8 1/2 12 Sub - X/O RIG 11 Drill collar RIG 9 Drill collar RIG 8 NMDrill collar BHI SSBN3350 7/8 7 NMStab - string BHI BHIN6629 16 3/4 6 NMSub - saver BHI BHIN6982 1/4 4 NMSub - pin pin BHI BHIN6882 1/4 3 Sub - bit BHI OWS-XOS-276 1/2 2 Bit - hole opener BHI 21469 36 1/2 1/2 1 Bit - mill tooth - roller cone SMITH MJ0398 17 1/2 Bit Parameters I TBR/Run Graded By Grade In Grade Out NO NO NO NO TD 17800 BHI/Ali Type Type Hole Opener IADC Code TFA in^2 TFA in^2 Jets Jets 20, 18 12 Gauge Len ft Stabilization Details Drill Pipe Details No Type Ser # Shape Blade Len ft Blade Gge Width Len in ft Gge In ft Gge Out ft Drill Grade Pipe Sect OD in Nom Wt lb/ft Len BHA Buoyed Wt klbf BHA Wt Below Jars klbf Motor Details Component Details Manufacturer Nozzle in/32 Type Operating Delta psi S/N No Load Delta psi Motor Size in Bit To AKO Bend Tilt Angle deg Bit To UBHS UBHS To Stator Stab Geology Fluid Parameters Formation Top MD Top TVD Description Mud Type Sea Water Mud Weight sg PV cP YP lbf/ 100ft^2 Gels / lbf/100ft^2 Survey Update Inc In deg Inc Out deg Azi In deg Azi Out deg Max TVD Max DLS Plan deg/100ft DLS Range deg/100ft 0.82 0.37/2.26 Drilling Parameters Mode Dist.

BHA Performance / Observations A very long and good run. In the sand it was easy to maintain very high ROP with controlled NBI. Steering in the sand was no problem and the pewrformance was higher than theoretical. However, one experienced that the tool was sensitive to formation changes and stringers with the result of HLD both for inclination and azimuth. BHA Conclusions / Recommendations / Remarks The assembly was very sensitive to hard stringers, and some of this effect is probably caused by the lower Flex-Stabilizer. The decoding was poor when the flow was less than 1750lpm and impossible under 1600lpm right from the start of the run. The tool was supposed to be medium flow tool with flow range 1200 -2060lpm, but it behaved more like standard flow tool. BHA Reason POOH Not able to correct NBI or Azimuth due to dull bit.

Sampling started from 2190m MD (1404,8m TVD). One spot and one dried sample were taken every 10 to TD, both for Y1H and Y2H. All formation tops are preliminary, and are based on information available at the wellsite. All depths are referenced to meters below RKB if not otherwise stated. Gas analysis were accomplished using HP 6890 Flame Ionisation Detectors (FID) with total gas measured as percentage methane (C1) equivalent in air, and the chromatographic analysis is expressed as parts per million (ppm). Gas peaks and chromatograph break down are listed at the end. The gas values towards the end of Y2H are low. Due problems with the shale shaker screens, all eight shakers were going. Because of this, the mudlevel in the flowlines were to low and the gastrap was not in the right position to get good readings.
