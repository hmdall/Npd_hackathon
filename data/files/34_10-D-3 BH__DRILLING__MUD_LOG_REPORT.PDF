INTRODUCTION: This report comprises the directional drilling services on well 34/10-D-3-BH Directional drilling services from Baker Hughes Inteq include all sections. 2. WELL DESIGN: 34/10- D-3-BH was planned as three dimensional long radius well with plan of 4,2/30m DLS. The well was planned to be sidetracked with whipstock and the 3-d curve drilled fist by motor M1X then by Autotrak 1.5. 8 1/2 Hole Section: This well will be sidetracked from the 5/8 casing using Whipstock. The whipstock will be followed by Mk1X AKO set at 1.2 tilt, this tool is expected to be run until the MWD is clear of magnetic interference and is planned to give 4DLS for this 100m MD. An Autotrak will drill the rest of the section to accomplish up to 4.2 DLS in complicated 3D profile in order to fulfill the target requirements.Well : 34/10-D-3BH Total measured depth: 4112 Total vertical depth: Slot co-ordinates: 61deg 07min 02deg 14min RKB to Seabed: 159 36 section to 227m MD (227m TVD) 26 section to 17 %2 section to 12 1/4 section to 8 %2 section to RKB to MSL: 25 MSL to Seabed: 134 30 casing set at 219m MD (219m TVD) 20 casing set at 709 MD (700.0m TVD) 13 3/8 casing set at Kicked off 34/10-D-3BH BHI representative: Customer representative: (sign) ...................................................(sign) (print) (print) Date:<- True Vertical Depth (metres) Scale cm = 80 7.000in Liner - Inc, Md, Tvd, VS Statoil Location: Norway Slot: Slot #3 Field: GULLFAKS Well: 34/10-D-3 BH (definitive) Installation: Gullfaks-Sr Scale cm = 80 East (metres) -> 20,000in Casing - Inc, Md, Tvd, VS D-3 BH (PWB) 7.000in Liner - Tvd, N, D-3 BH (definitive) Tie on - Tvd, 20,000in Casing - Tvd, N, 30,000in Conductor - Tvd, S, Created by : Planner Date plotted : 4-Dec-2002 Plot reference is D-3 BH (definitive).

DRILLING SUMMARY: 8 1/2 Hole Section Whipstock was set at 60 Rt of Highside. Top of window at 3078,6md. Top of Whipstock at 3079,3. Bottom of window at 3082,7m. Milled hole to 3087,2m. Due to error in pipe tally depth corrected to: Top of window at 3060md. Bottom of window at 3064.2m. Milled hole to 3069m. General Objective for the 1/2section: M1X set at 1.2 tilt with rock bit will drill the fist 100m. Orienting 17m per stand with 70 Right Tool Face should give to 4DLS and should be clear of magnetic interference by 3185m (6  8m away from old hole). The Autotrak with TC and Co-Pilot will continue the right turn with 4DLS for another 13 to 343 azimuth and line up on H1 (top Rannoch). This BHA will be used to follow the target box by turning left and building with 4.2 DLS and geosteering where necessary. Lithology: Shetland, Brent. Mud Type: Oil Base Mud at 1.60sg. BHA #1: 3088m to 3088m Later changed to 3069m due to correction in pipe tally. 8 1/2 Rock Bit MX09DX, 3/4 M1X 1.2Tilt with 3/8 SOS, 3/8 NM String Stab, MWD + DCP, 2 5 NMSCHWDP, 5 HWDP, 1/2 JAR, HWDP, Accelerator, 5 HWDP, & 1/2 DP to Surface.

Was able to work the string down to 3068m but there was motor stalling and string stall-out which finally required pulling out to check the condition of the BHA and evaluate clean-up trip with mills. It was later discovered that the Whipstock was 18,5m higher than was thought - This meant the restriction was in the window. There was much junk marks on the 5 NMCSDP boxes and down including the MWD. The motor checked out OK, both Tilt setting and pump test. The bit was badly damaged by junk on the outer rows.It was decided to do mill run. An obstruction was milled away at the top of the window & the window polished up. 8 1/2 Rock Bit MX09DX,  M1X 1.2Tilt with 3/8 SOS, 3/8 NM String Stab, MWD + DCP, Inclination in/out 23 No surveys Azimuth in/out 25 No surveys WOB 10-15 Flow Rate 2000 Torque 8-10 SPP 250 RPM 70-90 Average ROP Bit grade WT NO BHA Drilling 9,9 Circulating 11,4 Bearings in 3mm Bearings out 3mm Entering the window with this BHA was problem free.

The remaining section was drilled without directional problems. Good steering prediction made it possible to closely follow the plan, although the entire section was continuos build/turn. It was important to stay close to the plan because of the proximity to D-3 AT2H, which was crossed at 3700m MD with distance of 24m and a CF of 1,36. Approaching T1 it was decided to divert from plan by continuing turn to south/west to obtain maximum exposure of Etive.DRILLING AND ENGINEERING The tophole sections of D-3H were drilled by Transocean Wildcat. 13 3/8 casing was set at 2072m MD (2034.4m TVD). Transocean Wildcat drilled 12 '  observation hole from the 13 3/8 casing shoe. This hole was then plugged back and the well 34/10-D-3H temporarily abandoned. Deepsea Trym re-entered in October 1999, and kicked off the 12 '  section of D-3 AH at 2095m MD (2057.3m TVD). Due to hole problems the 12 '  hole was cemented back and sidetrack, D-3 AT2H, kicked off at 2110m MD (2072.2m TVD). 5/8 casing was set at 3857m MD (3427.2m TVD). horizontal 1/2 section was drilled to 4934m MD (3476.8m TVD), and 7 liner set (top liner 3809.6m MD). A 7 VAM completion string was run, production packer set at 3502.5m MD, and the well produced through perforations in 5/8 casing and 7 liner. However, production rates were not as expected. Deepsea Trym returned in January 2002 to plug back D- 3AT2H and to drill another sidetrack D-3BH. After re-entry, the contents of the production string were bullheaded back into the reservoir with 36m3 base oil followed by total of 176m3 50/50 MEG/Drillwater. An EZSV cement retainer was set by wireline at 3513m. The production string was then perforated by wireline charge at 3472-3473m, and the well killed by diplacing to 1.35SG Glydrill mud.

Drilling/ Hole Problems: With tripsaver Whipstock 8.5 window was milled in the 5/8 casing from 3060 to 3064m MD. It continued to drill 5m new formation down to 3069 before an FIT was performed, taken to SG as per prognosis. A tricone bit (Bit1) was run to polish the window build angle and orient the hole, but was pulled due to restrictions in hole. Later it was found that bit had been rotating on the whipstock and in the window. This was due to failure in the pipe tally. milling assembly (Bit2) was run and polished the window. new tricone bit (Bit3) was run and drilled successfully down to 3119m before pulling out of hole to change the BHA. A PDC bit (Bit4) was then run in at 3119m MD with an Autotrak. This bit drilled without any problems all the way to TD @ 4112m MD (3493.7m TVD). Casing: Run 7 tubing and completion string. Cementing: Yes Directional Drilling: The objective was to drill the well in two runs. The first run was to be drilled with motor to achieve dogleg of deg/30 meters according to planned wellpath. The second run was to be drilled with an Autotrak and achieve dogleg of  deg/30 metes. The section would be geosteered in the Etive (Rannoch) Formation. The goal was 100 reservoir section in Etive. Results: All objectives met. MWD: Service provided by Triple Combo and Co-Pilot.

Claystone: Olive grey to dark greenish grey, occasionally greyish brown, rarely reddish brown. Cuttings were firm to hard, subblocky. The claystone was in parts calcareous, with silty or sandy horizons. Traces of carbonaceous material were also present. Limestone: Light to medium grey, greenish grey, occasionally brownish grey. Moderately hard, with blocky morphology. The limestone was microcrystalline, and argillaceous in parts. Total gas ranged from to 0.15% with an average of 0.12%. Draupne Formation: 3213m - 3225m MD (3093m - 3102m TVD) This interval consisted of claystone and argillaceous limestone. Claystone: Dark olive grey to dark grey, occasionally greenish grey. The cuttings were firm and subblocky. It was commonly calcareous, also slightly silty and micropyritic. Limestone: Light to medium grey, also brownish grey, moderately hard, and argillaceous. Total gas ranged from to 0.13%. Heather formation: 3225m - 3350m MD (3102m - 3205m TVD) The Heather consisted of dark claystone with occasional stringers of limestone. Claystone: Dark olive grey to dark grey, olive black, occasionally brownish grey, firm to moderately hard, with subblocky cuttings. Commonly organic rich and carbonaceous, frequently with micropyrite. Occasionally calcareous especially in upper parts of the formation, with thin limestone interbeds. Limestone: Light grey to medium grey, brownish grey, moderately hard, producing blocky to subblocky shaped cuttings. It was microcrystalline and occasionally argillaceous. Total formation gas ranged from to 0.70%, showing slight increase of average levels with depth. No significant peaks. RESERVOIREtive Formation: 3350m - 3380m MD (3205m - 3226m TVD) The top reservoir was entered in sandstones of the Etive formation. Sandstone: Cuttings at surface generally consisted of loose, desegregated grains. The sand consisted of clear, translucent, occasionally milky white, quartz.

Claystone: Medium to dark grey or olive grey, firm, silty and micropyritic Limestone: Trace only. Light grey to medium grey, brownish grey, moderately hard. Average formation gas ranged from to 4%, with few significant peaks to 5.2%. Rannoch  Formation: 3533m - 3611m MD (3323m - 3366m TVD)Note, Stratigraphic turning point at 3611m MD (3366m TVD) The Rannoch -1 was more argillaceous section consisting of claystones and siltstones. Claystone: Medium to dark grey, olive grey, greyish black, firm, silty in parts and micropyritic Average formation gas ranged from 2% near the top of the section, reducing with depth to 0.3%. No significant peaks. Rannoch  Formation: 3611m - 3704m MD (3366m - 3408m TVD) After Stratigraphic turning point at 3611m MD (3366m TVD) The Rannoch 1, going up sequence, continued as an argillaceous section, with claystones, siltstones and silty sand. Siltstone: Medium grey, firm to loose, blocky, argillaceous, slightly calcareous in parts, grading to very fine sandstone. Average formation gas was low, ranging from to 0.5%. No significant peaks. Rannoch  Formation: 3704m - 3876m MD (3408m - 3456m TVD) Drilling up sequence. This was section of finer grained sandstones, frequently silty, with shaly interbeds. Sandstone: Clear, translucent, occasionally yellowish brown, in parts off white, quartz. Firm to loose. Grain sizes were dominantly very fine, but some grains were fine to medium, subangular to subrounded, moderately to well sorted. In parts calcitic and with kaolinitic matrix. Traces of pyrite nodules were also present. Average formation gas ranged from to 4%, generally showing an increase with depth, with few significant peaks to 5.7%. Rannoch  Formation: 3876m - 3903m MD (3456m - 3461m TVD)This was another section of finer grained sandstones. Sandstone: Clear, translucent, occasionally moderate yellowish brown, in parts off white, quartz. Firm to loose. Grain sizes were dominantly very fine, but some grains were fine to medium, subangular to subrounded, moderately to well sorted. In parts calcitic and with kaolinitic matrix. Locally silty and micromicaceous. Traces of pyrite nodules were also present. Average formation gas ranged from to 4%, with no significant peaks. Final Formation (Etive?) : 3903m - 4112m MD TD (3461m - 3493m TVD) The hole section  BH was completed in generally coarser grained sandstones. Sandstone: Cuttings at surface generally consisted of loose grains, but some aggregates could be distinguished. The sand consisted of clear, translucent, occasionally off white, quartz. Sizes dominantly ranged from fine to medium, locally very fine or coarse, moderately well sorted, subangular to subrounded. Kaolinitic or calcitic in parts. Siltstone: Trace only. Medium grey, firm to loose, blocky, sandy, slightly calcareous or pyritic in parts. Average formation gas ranged from to 3%, with peaks up to 5.1%.

DRILLING SUMMARY: With tripsaver Whipstock 8.5 window was milled in the 5/8 casing from 3060 to 3064m MD. It continued to drill 5m new formation down to 3069 before an FIT was performed, taken to SG as per prognosis. A tricone bit (Bit1) was run to polish the window build angle and orient the hole, but was pulled due to restrictions in hole. Later it was found that bit had been rotating on the whipstock and in the window. This was due to failure in the pipe tally. milling assembly (Bit2) was run and polished the window. new tricone bit (Bit3) was run and drilled successfully down to 3119m before pulling out of hole to change the BHA. A PDC bit (Bit4) was then run in at 3119m MD with an Autotrak. This bit drilled without any problems all the way to TD @ 4112m MD (3493.7m TVD). MUD SUMMARY: Versavert Oil Based Mud with mudweight SG was used throughout the whole section. LITHOLOGY: Lithology was predominantly Shale, with minor interbedded Limestone. Towards the base of the section in the Brent Group reservoir it became Sandstone with interbedded Shale. GAS SUMMARY: The background gas for this section ranged between to 2.9%. From 3356m MD to 3541m MD gaspeaks between to 10.4% were observed. From 3716m MD to 4084m MD gaspeaks up to were observed. Intervals before, inbetween and after had no gaspeaks. MUD TEMPERATURE: Temperature data was of little use with this section Dxc SUMMARY: Dxc data is of no use in this section due to the use of mud motor in the upper section and the lithology being primarily sandstone. PRESSURE SUMMARY: Hole stability, hole cleaning and mudweight/gas relationship all indicate that a good overbalance was maintained with mudweight of SG. No trip or connection gases were observed throughout the section and their is no data to indicate that the pore pressure was anything other than prognosed.DEPTH (m MD) ROTARY TORQUE MAXIMUM (kN-m) TORQUE PLOT 34/10-D-3BH 8 1/2 HOLE SECTION SCALE: to ROTARY SPEED STRING (RPM) AVERAGE (kN-m) TOTAL BIT (RPM)^ TORQUE PLOT 34/10-D-3BH 1/2 HOLE SECTION SCALE: to ^ ^ DEPTH (m MD) 0 01 30 02 ROTARY TORQUE MAXIMUM (kN-m) AVERAGE (kN-m) 04 50 50 001 502 002 501 ROTARY SPEED STRING (RPM) TOTAL BIT (RPM) 300 350CEMENT SQUEEZE Well : 34/10-D-3T2H 11th January 2002 TIME 04:00:00 CEMENT PUMP PRESSURE (bar) PIT VOL CHANGE (m3) Start Squeezing Cement Total Volume Squeezed (from pit volumes) approx 22 m3^ FORMATION INTEGRITY TEST Well : 34/10-D-3BH FIT AT 5/8 SHOE, 3064m MD (2957.7m TVD) ^ ^ TIME CEMENT PUMP PRESSURE (bar) 11:00:00 11:10:00BULLHEAD BASEOIL / MEG 5th January 2002 16:00:00 End Base Oil.
