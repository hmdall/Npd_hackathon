Important logging goals in this well were to identify gas- oil and oil-water contacts. 2 Logging operations Two logging jobs were done in this well. Both jobs consisted of LWD (GR/RES/DEN/NEU) in the 12 1/4 and the 1/2 sections, respectively. These jobs are further described in sections 2.1 and 2.2. E:\66 Brnn\A-41\663 Petrofysikk\Petrofysikk rapport A-41.doc2.1 Logging job no.1 Two bit runs were done in this section with ARC/ADN. Note that ARC was run in CDR mode only. No major problems were experienced during this job. See Table and section report for further details. Table 2-1 Logging job no. 1.

The following were, however, noted: - The DEN/NEU separation in the oil zone is higher than theoretically expected. This is seen in both the 12 1/4 and in the %2 section. - The resistivity curves are noisy for high values of resistivity indicating that the tool is close to the upper limit of the tool. - In the same formation and fluid (Garn oil zone) the resistivity from the 12  section  P28H_UNC from ARC is reading significantly lower than P34H_UNC from ARC in the %2 section. Raw curves are listed in Table 4-1. 3.2 Composite curves The composites curves (and evaluation curves) are listed in Table 4-2 were details about splice depths, depth shifting and editing are found. The composite curves were created from LWD curves in both the %2 and in the 12 1/4 section. 3.3 Processing The processing was done according to the Heidrun Evaluation model as of 2003. Well specific parameters are listed in Table 3-1 The quality of the evaluation curves (QUAL_FLAG) were defined as medium in this well mainly based on the uncertainties associated with the raw curves as mentioned in section 3.1. In the gas zone there is additional uncertainties in the evaluation due to uncertainty associated with mud invasion effects. Due to the differences in resistivity responses in the 12 1/4 and in the %2 section the calculated water saturation Sw becomes quite different in the two sections. From field knowledge it is to be expected that Sw in the %2 section is closest to the true value.Well statistics is given in Table 3-2 and CPI plot is found in Appendix. Evaluation curves are listed in Table 4-2.

A gas-oil contact was interpreted as being in Garn Fm. at depth 3213 MD / 2327 TVSMSL which is TVD deeper that the original gas-oil contact in this segment. 4 References Section reports well A-41.App Raw and processed log curves Table 4-1: Raw curves Curve name Service Run# Ver# Intrp Top MD Base MD Top TVD Tool Code Remark A16H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC A22H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC A28H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC A34H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC A40H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC DRHB ARC/ADN RAW ADN DRHL ARC/ADN RAW ADN DRHO ARC/ADN RAW ADN Bulk Density Correction DRHR ARC/ADN RAW ADN Bulk Density Correction, Right DRHU ARC/ADN RAW ADN Bulk Density Correction, Up GR_ARC ARC/ADN RAW ARC HORD ARC/ADN RAW P16H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC P22H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC P28H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC ARC5 Non-BHCorr Phase-Shift Resistivity 28-in. at MHz P28H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC P34H_UNC ARC/ADN RAW ARC PEF ARC/ADN RAW ADN Photoelectric Factor RHOB ARC/ADN RAW ADN Bulk Density ROBB ARC/ADN RAW ADN ROBL ARC/ADN RAW ADN ROBR ARC/ADN RAW ADN ROBU ARC/ADN RAW ADN TNPH ARC/ADN RAW ADN VERD ARC/ADN RAWDate Rev. no. 10 of 16 Table 4-2 Processed and evaluation curves Curve name Ver# Intrp Top MD Base MD Top TVD Remark BVW STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 COAL_FLAG STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 DEVIATION STAT FLUID_FLAG STAT GR STAT GR_ARC:r1:v1 2491 GR_ARC:r2:v1 3348 GR_ARC:r3:v1 KLOGH STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 PEF STAT PEF:r1:v1 2483 PEF:r2:v1 3341-3368 PEF:r3:v1 (gaps filled) PHIF STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 QUAL_FLAG STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RHOB STAT 2145 RHOB:r1:v1 2483 RHOB:r2:v1 3340-3370 RHOB:r3:v1 3612 (gaps filled) RT STAT RT:rCv7 with pol.horn renoved and gaps filled SAND_FLAG STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 SW STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 SXO STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 TVDMSL STAT VSH STAT Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 GR_NORM PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 H_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 HIF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 KH_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 KV_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 LIME_FLAG PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 NPHI_NORM PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 NTG_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 pef_zero PEF PHID PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 PHIN PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 PHINET_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 PHINT PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RES_FLAG PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RHOF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RHOMA PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RHOMF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RMF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 RW PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 SW_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 SWIRR_MF PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 SWU PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 SXOU PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 TEMP PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 VSHDN PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 VSHGR PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 WELL_FLAG PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 W ELLTEMP PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003 ZONE_FLAG PEF Interpreted with HeidrunEval as of 2003Date Rev. no. 11 of 16 Table 4-3 Default parameters in the HeidrunEval model Stratigraphic unit Intrp Parameter name String Value Num Value Unit of meas Garn - re STAT unitless Garn - re STAT AJ UNKNOWN Garn STAT AK unitless Ile STAT AK unitless Not STAT AK unitless Ror STAT AK unitless Tilje STAT AK unitless Tilje STAT AK UNKNOWN Tilje STAT AK UNKNOWN re STAT AK unitless re STAT AK UNKNOWN re STAT AK unitless Garn - re STAT BJ UNKNOWN Garn STAT BK unitless Ile STAT BK unitless Not STAT BK unitlessPetrophysical Operation and Evaluation Report.
