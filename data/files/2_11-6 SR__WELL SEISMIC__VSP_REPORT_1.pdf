Migration Results APPENDIX 1: FIRST ARRIVAL PICKING APPENDIX 2: SONIC LOG CALIBRATION PROCEDURE APPENDIX 3: VSP DECONVOLUTION APPENDIX 4: DERIVATION OF TRANSPOSED DISPLAYThe data was acquired by READ Well Services August 1990. The survey consisted of Normal Incidence VSP and Rig Source VSP shot from to m. MD RKB. The seismic source employed for the surveys was single 550 cuin airgun with WSK, depth3.5 m., air pressure 2000 psi. The near field monitor hydrophone was kept at an offset of m. Further details are to be found in the section Field Operations Report. The receiver array consisted of main tool and satellites, each containing component geo- phone cartridge. Thus levels were acquired simultaneously. Weather conditions were described as good. The following is summary of the levels acquired: From Spacing to (m. MD RKB): 4020.0 (10) 3490.0 (20) Two Check Shots were done one way up with main tool at 928 and 383 MD RKB, giving the 10 hours (logging time) were used for the survey. A copy of the Seismic Field Report is included in the Section 'Field Operations Report'. Editing, stacking and timing of data The component geophone data was displayed at large scale and each component edited. The in- dividual near field monitor records were timed to the main peak, and the corresponding geophone traces shifted by this time. It was found that this system delay was stable during the survey at 20 +/- ms. Data in each level was aligned by maximizing the cross-correlation inside window after the first break: the data is resampled to 1/4 ms for this purpose. The geophone data was then stacked using median algorithm. summary of the traces included in the stack at each level, the system delays and residual alignment delays are contained in the Stack Report. The first arrival time was taken as the top of the first peak: this corresponds to 'trough-to-trough' picking. The reader is refered to Appendix 1: First Arrival Picking for full discussion of this pro- cess. A total of 159 Normal Incidence levels were recorded on the way up. The the levels above 1490m were noisy and excluded from VSP processing. Hence 159 levels were included in the check shot report and sonic calibration.153 levels were pro- cessed as VSP data set.Check shot computations, calibration of Sonic Logs Using the first arrival values picked above, and information on survey geometry, the Check Shot Report was produced. Details of the computations and results are included in this section. The sonic, density, gamma ray and caliper logs were read from tape supplied from the client, then edited after consultations with the client. Details of editing are to be found on the side label of the Calibrated Sonic Log (Enclosures Al and A2). After careful examination of the calculated drift be- tween the integrated sonic log and check shot values, drift corrections were applied to the sonic log. Details of these drift corrections are given at the beginning of the Calibrated Sonic Log. The logs themselves are displayed at two scales, 1:1000 (Enclosure Al) and 1:500 (Enclosure A2). These show the uncalibrated and calibrated sonic logs, density log, raw integrated sonic time, calibrated integrated sonic time and check shot information. The reader is refered to Appendix 2: 'Sonic Log calibration procedure'. The calibrated sonic log now provides an unique time / depth relationship over the entire logged interval, together with velocity information. The logs were then resampled to the time domain, at 2ms TWT sample interval. Using the velocity and density logs, an acoustic impedance log, reflec- tion coefficient series and transmission loss log were calculated. listing of these logs is provided in the section Time Domain Velocity Report. Velocity and density models were made above and below the logs: details of these are to be found on the side label of the Synthetic Seismograms (En- closures A4 and A5). Two suites of synthetic seismograms are shown, (A4) using Ricker wavelets, (A5) using Butterworth wavelets. The calibrated velocity log is presented with linear time scales of 10 cm/s and 25.4cm/s (10 inch's) for direct comparison with the surface seismic. (`Velocity Log - Linear Time Scale': Enclosures A3 and A3a) Data in the interval - MD RKB was used in the Normal Incidence - and Rig Source VSP processing. The Rig Source VSP processing is described later. Fig 1. is an outline pre stack processing sequence (up to Raw stacks) described above. TRANSMISSION LOSS COMPENSATION Energy loss of the direct arrival is compensated for by normalizing the data in 40ms window after the first arrival. single scalar is applied to each trace to force the RMS amplitude in this window to unity.Fig 1: VSP Processing Sequence (Raw data to Raw Stacks) Trace Editing System Delay Compensation Field Geometry Statics + ms Median Stack Bandpass filter First Arrival Analysis Transmission Loss Compensation Window Length 40 ms. Fig 2. is an outline post stack processing sequence SPHERICAL DIVERGENCE COMPENSATION The loss of energy due to spherical divergence is compensated for by applying the scalar Si to sam- ple i, where Si = (Ti / TO) ** and Ti is the time of sample i, TO the first arrival time, and data dependant parameter in the range to 1.5., in this caseWAVEFIELD TRANSPOSITION This process moves data from the deconvolved Upgoing wavefield which lies directly under the first break line to the 'near trace' of the output. The length of the time window on each trace is de- fined as the FTB difference between the neighbouring traces. The algorithm used is described in more detail in Appendix 4. CORRIDOR STACK The corridor stack was produced by an average stack of traces to of the transposed wavefield. ATTRIBUTE PROCESSING The seismic signal can be regarded as an analytic signal with both real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part can be computed by Hilbert transform techniques. g(t) = R(t) cos x(t) , Real part h(t) = R(t) sin x(t) , Imaginary part R(t) is defined as the reflection strength and x(t) as the instantaneous phase. The time derivative of the instantaneous phase is called instantaneous frequency and can be smoothed in time to get the Weigthed average frequency. The sign of the seismic trace when the reflection strength has its max- imum value is determined and called Apparent Polarity. The different attributes has been computed on the final enhanced deconvolved upwave (12 - 80 Hz) and is presented as color displays. VSP Test processing The following steps in the processing has been tested: WAVEFIELD SEPERATION The downgoing wavefield is computed from the normalized aligned stack with median filter. 5, 7 and points median filters were tested. The downgoing wavefield is subtracted from the total wavefield to give the Upgoing wavefield. By inspection of these Upgoing wavefields and frequen- cy domain plots, points median filter was chosen for the wavefield separation. VSP DECONVOLUTION The operator is computed from the downgoing wavefield (Panel B, Display B2). The design win- dow was defined as 800 ms by inspecting the multiple energy. The low cut (12 Hz) in the Butter- worth filter that is defined as 'Desired Output' is taken from the FZ- and FK-plots (See enclosures). Different High-cuts were tested (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 Hz). These tests together with the FK plot conclude that 80 Hz high cut gives the optimum VSP result. 50 Hz high cut was also selected for comparison with the surface seismic. NOISE REJECI ION MEDIAN FILTER Different median filters (3, and points) were tested on the deconvolved Upgoing wavefield. These filters will enhance and smooth all events that are horizontal in two way travel time and sup- press all other events. The longer the filters are and the more an event dips the more the event will be suppressed. By subtracting the enhanced deconvolved Upgoing wavefield from the raw decon-volved wavefield 'Residual Residual' wavefield is produced. These wavefields will contain the events that has been suppressed in the median filtering, like clipping events, reflections from fault- planes, converted Shear waves etc. points median filter was selected. Data in the interval 4020 m. to 1490 m. MD RKB was used in the Rig Source VSP processing. The processing sequence up to Stack is the same as for the Normal Incidence VSP. Display RG1. The Stacks were rotated (forward rotation) to radial and transverse components, both in the Hori- zontal and Source - Receiver plane. Display RG2. Transmission loss was computed on the radial component in the Source - Geophone Plane. A point Median filter was used on the radial component for separation of downgoing and reflect- ed P-waves. The data were then rotated back (inverse rotation) to true vertical and true horizontal compo- nent, using the angles derived in the previous forward rotation. Downgoing and reflected energy were removed by median filtering. Display RG3. The two components (horizontal and vertical) were then migrated using Kirchoff Migration rou- tine. 30 degree aperture was selected. The components were migrated separately and together. The migrated results were deconvolved with operators from the Normal Incidence VSP. By com- parison of the tree different results (Display RG4) the migrated Vertical Component was selected for the composite displays. INTERPRETER'S COMPOSITE DISPLAYS Enclosures Ii, 12, 13 and 14 are composite displays of the available Well Seismic data, consisting of the following: Side label with acquisition and processing parameters for the VSP, synthetic seismogram and sur- face seismic data; Linear two way time scale; Depth scale below MSL; Velocity, Density, Acoustic Impedance logs, Reflection coefficients and Transmission Losses; Synthetic seismograms and cor- ridor stacks.The surface seismic from the line AN081 - 18, The same line with the Normal Inci- dence VSP spliced in, The same line with the Migrated Rig Source VSP spliced in; The VSP deconvolved upgoing wavefield, with trace spacing proportional to Receiver offset. The sonic and density logs, plotted orthogonally to the VSP, with linear depth scale 1:5000. Space is reserved for formation top interpretation: lines drawn at constant two way time can be 're- flected' at the first break line on the VSP and continued as lines of constant depth to the linear depth scale logs. The surface seismic data was read from tape. The well location was taken from the well prognosis. The reader is refered elsewhere for details of the processing of this data.Fig 2: VSP Processing Sequence (From Raw Stacks) Wavefield Separation: 5 Point Median Filter VSP Deconvolution...
