Introduction This file note describes the results of heavy mineral analysis of 22 samples from the Danian and Maastrictian section of well 6305/7-1, More Basin, Norwegian Sea and compares the results with data previously acquired from wells 6305/5-1, 6305/12-1, 6305/12-2, 6306/6-1 and 630610-1.The main aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the 6305/7-1 sandstones and time equivalent sandstones previously analysed in the area. subsidary aim was to determine whether there are any stratigraphic variations in mineralogy that would indicate change in provenance and provide correlation framework. 2. Analytical procedures For analytical methodology see previous reports from the More Basin (Morton; 1996., Morton; 1998). 3. Conclusions Only traditional Heavy Mineral analyses were undertaken on well 6305/7-1, as the work on the 6305/5-1 well indicated that there was no significant difference in garnet geochemistry throughout the reservoir interval. In the 6305/5-1 well, the most notable feature was the large decrease in Garnet/Zircon (GZi) and Rutile/Zircon (Ru Zi) ratios across the Cretaceous boundary into the Tertiary. It was considered that this may be the key element for correlating utilising the Heavy Minerals. The current work from the well 6305/7-1 provided an interesting insight to the value of heavy minerals. The first point of note is that it is extremely difficult to simply correlate the index mineral ratios between the two wells on the Ormen Lange structure, and the obvious Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary event in well 6305/5-1 is not evident in well 6305/7-1. Indeed the actual percentages of the mineral pairs are very different in the two wells, e.g. the GZi ratio in well 6305/7-1 is significantly lower than in sandstones in the 6305/5-1 well, as is the Apatite Tourmaline ratio (ATi). These observations on their own can be interpreted in number of ways. Clearly the different mineral ratios and trends would be easily reconciled if the two intervals were of different age, however the biostrat does not allow that possibility. Indeed the clear template correlation over the reservoir interval provided by the biostrat indicates that the same time slices generally have different mineral ratios. This could be explained by the entry point system tapping different source terrains but the differences are not really of that great magnitude to indicate vastly different hinterlands. More likely is that we have different entry point systems at least in part for the reservoir intervals in the two wells tapping subtly different parts of the same source terrain. Similar low ATi values recorded over the Tertiary/Cretaceous boundary in well 6305/7-1 have previously been recorded in the Danian (T10) in the 6306/10-1 well, which may provide an indication of the entry point system for Barden sandstone. The relatively higher ATi values over the same interval in well 6305/5-1 would represent different entry point system. Higher ATi values have been previously recorded in wells 6205/3-1 and 6305/12-1 , and although to the south of well 6305/7-1 and very unlikely to be the actual entry point system for the well 6305/5-1 sandstone, does give an indication of the possibility of subtle differences in the source terrain required for the variations observed.The only heavy mineral correlation point worthy of note within the time framework provided by the biostrat is the lowest ATi peak in well 6305/5-1 at 2765m and similar feature in well 6305/7-1 at 2976m. Otherwise the heavy mineral analyses cannot be used as means of correlation between the two wells. The most likely explanation given the data from the two new wells and the limited surrounding data points, is that the heavy minerals indicate that the 6305/7-1 sandstone at least in part is sourced from different entry point system compared to sandstones from the 6305/5-1 well, but both come from similar source terrain that has subtle differences providing variation. 4.
