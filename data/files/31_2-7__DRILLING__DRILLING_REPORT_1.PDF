The 5/8 casing was actually cut at 1584,0m instead of the planned 1585,0m. 0,5m of the lm difference was due to 0,5 sub which was taken out of the bha. but not compensated for. The last 0,5m could not be explained. The milling of the 5/8 casing was conducted in the interval 1584,0 - 1590,5m. The milling itself was successfully completed in hrs. The bit was pulled above the window and the well circulated for 2,5 hrs. clean up trip with 15 bit to top of bridge plug at 1596,0m was conducted, and the well circulated for hrs. The well was then displaced to CaCl2 brine, containing sized CaCO3 as fluid loss agent. ARKIVEKSEMPLAR RETURPETEK-ARKW imeWaVeb10-0131cl stotoil PETEK -ARKIV Ayd.TereNt. ' S.bh.

Use of drag type underreamer was then preferred to rock type underreamer since it was possible to achieve bigger hole size. However, the consolidation of the formation sand caused severe failure of the drag type underreamer, and only the interval 1984,0 - 1987,0 was opened. No back up tool was available on the rig, but 18 rock type underreamer was brought to the rig, causing approximately 12 hours waiting. The section 1987,0 - 1990,5 was then successfully under reamed It is doubtful that the same program will be used for later wells if similar operation is to be conducted. more consolidated formation sand than previously believed, indicates the following program: i) Cut casing ii) mill section iii) underream to 14 using rock type underreamer iv) underream to 18 (or max available diameter) using rock type underreamer and stabilizers plus guide nose. The service company involved, Servco, indicated that it was believed possible to combine points iii) and iv) in one operation. b) Clean up of metal debris from the casing milling operation was not satisfaCtory even after extensive circulation both in viscous mud and CaC12 brine. Metal debris was recovered inside the screen when sand bailer was run. - wrt, -!,2: Brine System The mud shale shakers, ditch, one of the mud pits, trip tank and some of the mud piping was used for the brine system in addition to two twin cartridge type filters (16 elements) coupled in series, 350 bbl portable tanks, 2 47 bbl acid tanks, paddle mixer and pump unit supplied from Dowell Schl. 4,5 hrs was spent on cleaning the mud system, but severe plugging of the filter elements due to CaCO3 particles was experienced. This emphasizes the problem of using the mud system for brine handling due to insufficient clean up. The deck space used by Dowell Schl. for their equipment was 15m 12m. 45 mins were lost in the displace.aent process from CaC12 brine containing CaCO3 (underreaming fluid) to clean CaCl2 brine (gravel pack fluid). This was due to that the agitator was accidently switched on in the mud pit used as settling tank just after crew change. In future, the brine handling system should be tried to be kept as closed system. The only recommended connection to the mud system is the shale shakers. Avoiding use of the mud system (pits and flowlines) will eliminate unavoidable losses of fluid caused by the system itself (e.g. suCtion above bottom of the pits) and also eliminate the time consuming operation of cleaning the pits. 3: Gravel Pack Operation 5200 kg gravel was mixed into the slurry and pumped into the hole. This includes 50% excess, 1730 kg, which theoretically should have been reverse circulated out after the test. However, 2800 kg were reverse circulated, indicating incomplete pack.The length of blank pipe run is normally chosen to allow reduction in the pack volume following the effect of the viscosity breaker added in the gravel pack slurry. The volume reduction is laboratory tested to be ca. 35%. Thus, if too much gravel is reversed out after the test, this may give as result that the top of the gravel pack is lower than the top of the screen after the 35% volume reduction is experienced. This may, of course, cause complete failure of the gravel pack. The gravel pack assy. run in 31/2-7 did not have either bottom (lower) or top (upper) tell tale screens (lower tell tale screens usually used in high density gravel pack operations as 31/2-7). The gravel slurry weight of SG compared to the displacement fluid density of SG will cause the heavy gravel slurry to rope down the work string. By not using tell tale screen only one screen out is observed, - the final. After final screen out only small amounts are able to be squeezed (0,08 m3 experienced). If roping then, only little amount of gravel slurry are trapped opposite the blank pipe when the operation is believed completed. The result is too little slurry opposite the blank pipe. 4: Reversed Flapper Valve A reversed flapper valve was used above the screen in order to reduce/eliminate fluid losses to the formation in the period between the gravel packing and flowing the well. The flapper valve was held open by the wash pipe during the gravel pack operation and closed as soon as the wash pipe was pulled. The flapper and the seat was made of material designed to shatter when subjected to 550 kg weight originated by the mule shoe on the production string. Regarding fluid losses, the valve is believed to have functioned. No/minor losses was experienced after shattering some fluid losses were experienced. However, fill was falling on top of the flapper valve causing severe problems to clean out. _ .5: Fluid Losses The amount of fluid lost which was able to trace back to actual operation was: 9.0 m3 (56 bbls) lost in the gravel pack operation (when the m3 (25661) 15% HC1 entered the formation). 3.0 m3 (20 bbls) lost when squeezing 15% HCl prior to start flowing. 0.6 m3 (4 bbls) lost when shattering the reversed flapper valve. During flow, total of 19-22 m3 ( bbls) brine was regained, indicating 6-10 m3 (40-60 bbls) lost during the milling and under reaming operation.Date Time Operation 220582 2100 Rigged up Schlumberger.
