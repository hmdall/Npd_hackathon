JOB COMPLETED.2. DRILLING ANALYSISEXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Well objective: The objective was to re-enter well 2/7-B 08A, sidetrack and drill down to top of the Ekofisk formation 3600 feet south and 3160 feet East of the platform centre. From the 9 7/8 casing shoe the objective was to drill 3400 ft horizontal section trough the Tor (TA) formation. Four separate phases would be perforated and stimulated in this layer. monobore completion including 1/2 liner would be run. The operation was planned to take 138 days at cost of 12,500,000 USD. Well summary: The 5/8 and the 13 3/8 casings were removed to below the 20 casing shoe and the well was sidetracked below this casing shoe. The 17 1/2 section was drilled in one run without any major problems. The 13 3/8 casing was run and cemented according to plans. The 12 section was drilled down to the top of Ekofisk Fm without major problems. Hycalog PDC drilled total of 5011 ft. An ATM-G3 bit was used to drill down to Mid. Lista. The hole was then underreamed to 17 from 10080' to 10495' before it was drilled down to the top of the Ekofisk Fm at 10742'. The 7/8 5/8 casing was run and cemented through an inner string according to the plan. The 1/2 section was drilled from the 7/8 casing shoe at 10735' ,to TD of 16000 ' md. Four drilling assemblies were run and no major problems were encountered during the drilling phase. The string twisted off when backreatning out of the hole after reaching TD and 60 hrs was used to recover the fish. Two attempts were made to log the section with TLC. Both times the tool string stood up just below the 7/8 casing shoe. The section was fmally logged with LWD tools. When RIH with the liner it got stuck 475' off bottom. When attempting to work it further down the BSP packer set prematurely. The liner was perforated below the 7/8 shoe and cemented. Several attempts were made to squeeze off the perforations in the liner without success. Two attempts were made to seal of the perforations with an internal casing patch. On first attempt the patch set prematurely above the perforations and had to be milled out. On second attempt the setting tool got stuck inside the patch. The patch had to be milled out again and the setting tool was recovered. The scab liner and tubing was ran and single phase stimulation was performed before the well was handed over to production. pageMajor Engineering and Operational Achievements.  12 Hycalog DS34HG PDC bit drilled 3211 ft during 24 hrs period.  First horizontal section drilled without problems with MWD equipment.  Drilled 3400 ft horizontal section without major problems. Deviations From the Procedure. - Not able to log horizontal section with TLC. Had to log reservoir section with LWD tools. Well stimulated in single phase instead of four separated phases as planned in original procedure Operational and Equipment Problems. Major operational problems: Severe paraffin build up on tubing wall was experienced when attempting to pull the DHSV. Had to run broach and bailer town the tubing to clean it. - Drill pipe twisted off when cutting casing. - Problems to mill the 13 3/8 casing due to soft contaminated cement below 250'. The soft cement made it impossible to control the rheology of the polyvis milling fluid. The soft cement also caused excessive vibration and torque up of the milling string. - Well start flowing when starting to run in hole with casing. Had to RIH with clean out assembly and circulate out gas. - String twisted off when backreaming out off hole. Left 6906 ft pipe in hole. Used a total of 60 hrs to fish. - Not able to pass 10748' with TLC string. Made one clean out run before 2nd. attempt. No success. Logged reservoir section with LWD. - Stuck with 1/2 liner when RM. Not able to work it down. - Not able to squeeze off perforations in 1/2 linerMajor Equipment problems: Problems to test 13 5/8 BOP. Poor inspection of BOP onshore. Had to install new Elmago Break. TSP set prematurely when attempting to work liner down. Two attempts to set an internal casing patch to isolate perforations in 1/2 linerKILL THE WELL REMOVE THE TUBING AND SET THE DEEP ABANDONMENT PLUG. Objective: The objective was to pull the dummy in the side pocket mandrel at 9010' MD. Then kill the well with sea water, squeeze the perforations with CaCO3-pill, remove the tubing, set an EZSV and set cement plug on top of the tubing, covering the liner lap. The objective was to complete the operation in between and days. Conclusion: Instead of pulling the side pocket mandrel in the tubing to establish circulation, the tubing was perforated with Schlumberger. Some problems with severe paraffm build up on tubing wall was experienced when attempting to pull the DHSV. The killing of the well, setting of EZSV and the cementing operations went as planned. The operation was completed in 11 days but only one shift was working in the start up off the operation. The number of days used converted to 24 hrs operation is days. Recommendations: No change to the procedure. Discussion: CHANGE IN PLANNED PROCEDURE. Due to possible strike in Schlumberger it was decided to perforate the tubing instead off pulling the sidepocket mandrel. If we had failed to pull the dummy we could risk to not have personnel and equipment available to perforate the tubing. CaC 03 PILL. The well was killed with one 70 bbls CaCO3 pill. The CaCO3 pill was mixed according to the program. page 10DOWNTIME ANALYSIS: A total of 26 hrs down time was logged for this section. Paraffm Build up on tubing: 21,5 his was used to clean the tubing before we succeeded to pull the DHSV. The tubing was cleaned by working wireline broach town the tubing, running bailer and flowing the well. Waiting: Total his downtime. his for waiting on crane driver and his waiting on rig to be skidded to B-19. page 11CUT/PULL/MILL CASING 9 5/8 / 13 3/8 The objective was to cut and pull the 5/8 casing down to minimum 1460'. Then cut, pull and mill the 13 3/8 casing to 150' below the 20 casing. Thus side track the well from the 20 casing shoe. The operation was planned to take minimum days. Cutting and pulling of the 5/8 casing went as planned. The 5/8 was cut at 3000 ft, without performing stretch test, and pulled without overpull. The 13 3/8 casing was cemented to surface but soft contaminated cement was found behind the casing. This caused problems with the milling operation due to contamination of the milling fluid and string torquing up due to excessive vibration. The casing was milled down to 490' and from there it was cut and pulled in pieces down to 1010' were the milling operation was re-started and continued down to 1340', allowing the well to be sidetracked below the 20 shoe. The operation was completed in 17 days. Recommendation: A 12 bladed casing mill was used to mill the 13 3/8 casing. The 12 bladed mill has limited flow by area and this could cause the cuttings to pack off below the mill. It is therefore recommended to not have more then 10 blades on the casing mill. REMOVING 5/8 CASING. The 5/8 casing was cut at 3000' and pulled . The reason for cutting the 5/8 casing as deep as we did was in case the CTC packer in the 13 3/8 5/8 annulus was leaking and we got pressure build up on surface. By cutting at 3000 ft we would be able to kill the well by circulating 17 ppg mud down to 3000 ft and thereby preventing to bullhead mud down the annulus which could be difficult. MILLING AND PULLING OF THE 13 3/8 CASING. The 13 3/8 casing was cut 3' below the top of the hanger and the milling assembly was picked up. The milling operation went without major problems down to 250'. Below 250' soft contaminated cement behind the casing made it impossible to control the rheology of the polyvis milling fluid. The polyvis system was changed to bentonite/XCD polymer page 12system. The soft contaminated cement behind the casing caused also excessive vibration and torque up of the milling string. The 13 3/8 casing was cut and pulled in pieces from 490' to 990'. Firm cement was found behind the casing below 1000' and the casing was milled down to 1340' with an average ROP of 8,5 ft/hr. bentonite/XCD polymer mud system was used for the milling operation. Below is the downtime in this part of the operation listed. Rpt Code Hours PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 14 7.c 8,5 Problems when attempting to test BOP.

Conclusion: total of 171 hrs down time was logged for this section. 91% of the down time was associated with the milling problems due to the soft cement behind the 13 3/8 casing. 10% down time (16 hrs) was caused by repair off rig equipment/ BOP. page 13DRILL TUE 17 1/2 SECTION SET 13 3/8 CASING The objective was to kick-off below the 20 casing shoe and drill the 17 1/2 section to 4919' TVD with steerable motor assembly and set 13 3/8 casing in approximately 10 days. rotary assembly would be used if the bit or motor failed after the well was lined up. The section was drilled in days, including 30 hrs to rig up the portable top drive. The operation went as planned. The section was drilled with one BHA in one run. No significant problems were encountered. Total reported trouble time was 4,5 hrs, mainly due to rig problems/repair. DRILLING. After the kick off plug was set and the cement plug was dressed the top drive was installed. The installation was completed in 35 hrs. Some rig maintenance and the testing off the BOP was done simultaneously with the top drive installation. A 13 ppg EMW leak off was achieved below the 20 shoe. A 17 1/5 Hughes Max-G1 and 5/8 Magnadrill motor was used to kick off and drill the section. Average ROP for the section was 58 ft/hr. This is relative high, compared with offset wells on 2/7B. At around 2200' md some problems with gumbo occurred. Excessive amounts of Gumbo was circulated out and wiper trip was performed to the 20 shoe. Max overpull was 55000 lbs. One more wiper trip was performed from 3774' to 2145'. No overpull was reported. RUNNING AND CEMENTING 13 3/8 CASING. BUTTRESS, D-95 HC was ran according to program. The casing was landed with the shoe at 5222' MD. page 14The casing was cemented with 278 bbls lead slurry and 104 bbls tail slurry, giving calculated TOC at 3149', using as effective diameter for the open hole (50% excess). The cementing operation went as planned without any problems.

DOWNTIME lire page 15DRILL THE 12 SECTION SET 7/8 5/8 CASING Displace to Novadrill Pseudo-oil based mud. Drill this section down to Mid-Lista @ +/- 9552TVD in one run using Hycalog DS34BHG PDC bit with 1/2 Navidrill motor. To optimize for torque and drag in the horizontal section modified catenary curve was planned with deg/100 ft continuously build down to 10466' MD. Then build from 40 deg inclination at 10466' to 50 deg at Mid Lista (10589' MD) with 1,31 deg/100ft build rate to line the well up to horizontal through the Tor Fm. Underream the hole to 17 from 800' TVD above top of Ekofisk Fm. to mid Lista. Then continue to drill tangent section with RGD rotary assembly down to pick the to top of Ekofisk Fm. Run one open hole log before running and cementing the 5/8 7/8 casing. Run VSP log before drilling out the 7/8 shoe. The operation was planned to take 32 days, including contingency The operation took total of 17 days and went largely as planned except from some well control problems causing downtime to the operation. The One run goal was not achieved. The Hycalog DS34BHG PDC bit drilled total of 5011 ft before it had to be pulled due to low ROP. The directional plan went according to the plan with the azimuth lined up for the horizontal section and with an inclination of 51 deg at top of the Ekofisk Fm. The section was drilled with ppg mud weight down to 10150' MD were it was increased to due to problems with gas. At Mid Lista (10560' MD) it had to be reduced back to due to losses. The casing was cemented through an imierstring with 60 to 75% return. Finally the VSP logging was performed according to program.. Continue the effort to design/select BHA that can drill the 12 section down to Mid Lista in one run. Drill 12 section with motor assembly and thereby reduce the effect of uncertainties as bit walk and BHA behaviour. Focus on performance prior to drilling the section. Make sure all major drilling equipment is inspected and in order prior to drilling out off the 13 3/8 casing shoe. Strap drill pipe prior to running casing. Do manual check on the drill pipe tally prior to running casing. Don't trust spreadsheet tallies. page 16DRILLING BHA 1. The BOP was nippled up before the BHA was picked up (12 DS34HG PDC bit, 1/2 Navidrill Mach 1C w/0.38 deg bent housing and 11 7/8 stabilizer). The shoe and the rathole was drilled out and the well displaced to Novadrill. An extended leakoff test was taken below the 13 3/8 shoe giving LOT of ppg EMW. During the first 24 hr period total of 3211 ft was achieved at 133 ft/hr including connection and survey time. Surveys was taken every third stand and orienting was necessary for approximately one hour. The first hard stringers were experienced below 7750 ft. The stringers ranged from 1-3 ft thick at intervals of approximately 20 ft. Below 8500 ft stringers were dominant feature. On occasions only 10 ft would separate stringer and drilling through each one ranged from - 30 minutes. The requirements to orient increased as deeper we came and consequently the penetration rate was reduced. At 10150 ft the penetration rate had been reduced to 10 ft/hr over hrs and it was decided to pull the bit. The DS34HG drilled 4905 ft of new formation in 64 hrs. Average ROP was 76 ft/hr including connection and survey time. The bit was graded 5-7-BT-NS-X-IN-CT- PR. BHA 2. A new rotary assembly, designed to build angle, was made up with 12 ATM-G3 and Gamma Ray tool. slight gain was observed on the way in and the mud weight had to be increased from ppg to ppg to get the gas level down. The assembly drilled from 10150 ft to Mid Lista at 10560 ft in hrs giving and average ROP of ft/hr. The assembly was building 1,5 deg/100 ft increasing the inclination from 47 deg to 51 deg during the 264' drilled. The bit was graded 3-3-BT-C-E-I-CT-BHA. BHA 3. The hole was underreamed to 17 from 10080' to 10495' with 13 ft/hr average ROP. Due to losses (20 bbllhr) the mud weight was cut back to ppg prior to POOH with the underreamer. A rotary/RGD assembly drilled the well down to 10' above the top of Ekofisk Fm at 10742' MD - 9336' TVD. Several 2-3 ft thick hard stringers was experienced and 10-30 min was spent on each stringer. Sperry Sun multishot survey was dropped prior to POOH. LOGGING. One open hole log ( BHC-LDL-GR-AMS) was performed prior to running casing and 3D-Walkaway VSP was performed after the casing was set. page 17RUNNING AND CEMENTING CASING. 4269 ft of 7/8 and 6410 ft of 5/8 casing were run as planned. Shoe depth is at 10735' md and casing slip joint was included at 10243 ft. The casing shoe was set 27 ft TVD above the top of the Ekofisk Fm. 15' discrepancy in the drill pipe tally contributed to this. It was not discovered before the casing shoe was drilled out. MWD logs including directional data has been has been corrected accordingly, but the depths in the DIMS drilling report have not been corrected. No mud losses was reported during the running off the casing. After the casing was landed the pack off was set and the stab-in seal stem was made up and RIFI on drill pipe. The Novadrill in the annulus between the casing and the open hole was displaced with 498 bbls of Kla Cure mud with 60-75% return. The casing was then cemented with 53 bbls Dycckerhof cement slurry. 75% return was reported during the cement job. This was sufficient to give us the required cement strength around the shoe. When the cement job was completed the seal stem was pulled out off the stab-in shoe an the well was displaced to seawater. The CTC packer at 5148 was inflated on the way out. A G2 high accuracy gyro was original called for in the program but it was cancelled in agreement with Geology. 38,39 7.b 15,0 Install new Elmago break. 39 7.b 1,0 Change out damaged lube oil pump on top drive. 40 7.b 2,0 Problems with top drive. 44 Increase mud weight due to gas boiling in bell nipple. 44 7.a 0,5 Repair leak in pump manifold. 45 0,5 Work tight spot at 5713 ft. 46 7.b 0,5 Change filter on top drive. 47 3.c 0,5 Observe well due to losses.

DOWNTIME 48 Hrs Conclusion: Downtime due to rig equipment caused 41% of total downtime. 56% downtime was caused by problems with well control, loss circulation or unstable hole. page 18DMA, THE SECTION. SET LINER. Objective: Kick off and build the angle to horizontal. Drill 3400 ft long horizontal section through the Tor Fm. Use MWD and biostratigraphical cuttings analysis to establish/confirm position in reservoir. Log the reservoir section with TLC logs. Run and cement liner. Conclusion: The section was completed in 64 days. 19 days to drill and log the section and 45 days to run and cement liner and clean out liner to TD. The drilling of the section was completed in runs using ATM-P22G bit. Some problems with sticking were experienced. An attempt to turn the well to left at the end of the section had to be cancelled due to problems with differential sticking when orienting. The section was logged with LWD after doing two attempts to R111 with TLC tools. Both time the TLC string tagged up at 10748'. A total of 885 his ( 37 days) down time was reported from the time the liner was ran in hole until it was cemented and cleaned out to TD. The primary problem was caused by the TSP prematurely setting when RH1 with the liner. Secondary problems being to isolate the perforations made in the liner below the 7/8 shoe. The perforations was made to be able to cement the liner with return after the TSP was set. Recommendations: - It is recommended to drill the horizontal section with PDC bit and high torque PDM motor. - It is very important to get smooth build up to horizontal and prevent high doglegs. High doglegs can create problems with key seating in the chalk. Milling operations inside liner should be performed with proper milling fluid to assure good hole cleaning. The problem being the low mud velocity in the dp 9 7/8 annulus due to limited pump rates through the slim pipe inside the page 19Discussion: Run 1: The BHA was made up of 1/2 ATM22G bit, 3/4 Navidrill Mach with 3/8 Near bit stabilizer, 3/4 stabilizer, MWD tools (Baker Hughes), circ sub, 100 ft HWDP and jar. second mechanical jar was run 3200 ft behind the bit. The assembly drilled from 10742' md to 12663' md, 1921 ft of new formation in 26 hrs. 481' was oriented. The assembly was pulled due to hours on bit. Experienced no abnormal problems during this run. Run 2: The 3/4 stabilizer on top of the motor was changed to stabilizer and new 1/2 ATMP22G bit was made up. The assembly drilled from 12663' to 14443'. Only 60 ft was oriented and average ROP was 62 ft/hr. When trying to orient at 13629' we had to pull 300000 lbs overpull to get free. Due to the differential sticking problems it was decided to revert from the original directional plan that called for deg/100' turn to right. The well was therefore drilled straight without orienting to the right after 13629'. Towards the end of this run the losses increased from 10 to 40 barrels per hour. Adding of Mix-II was increased from to sacks/hr and the losses decreased to 10 barrels per hour. The assembly was pulled due to hours on bit. Run 3: A new motor and ATM22G was made up and RIH with the same BHA configuration. The assembly drilled from 14443' to 15422'. total of 979' with an average ROP of 37 ft/hr. Losses around 20 to 30 barrels per hour was experienced. At the end an attempt was made to drop inclination. From 14830' to 14993' the hole was drilled with the tool face on the low side, inclination dropping deg. At 15422' the assembly was pulled to hours on bit and to change to drop assembly. Run 4: A full gauge stabilizer was put on top of the motor and 1/4 stabilizer was installed on top of the MWD tools. new ATM22G bit was made up and RIM. Tight hole areas was experienced between 10995' to 12843'. Had to wash and ream through. The assembly drilled from 15422 to TI) at 16000 ft, dropping the inclination from deg to deg. Average ROP was fph. The string was backreamed on the way out due to tight hole. At 14685' the string torqued up to 25000 ft-lbs with 175,000 lbs overpull resulting in the upper jar to fire and the string to part. 6906 ft long fish was left in the hole. An overshot was run and latched onto the fish and 15% HCL acid was pumped to free the fish without success. new attempt was made with modified overshot and citric acid was pumped. The fish got free but on the way out it got stuck again at 11124. back off was made below the overshot and open ended pipe was ran back in and screwed into the fish. The fish was then pulled by working the tight areas up and down before pulling out of hole. The fishing operations took 60 hours. page 20LOGGING The original plan called for two TCL logging runs. When RIH with the first TLC string the tool string stood up at 10748', 13 ft below the 7/8 shoe. clean out run was performed and second attempt was done with TLC. The tools string stood again up at 10752'. It was than decided to cancel the TLC logging and log the section with the LWD tools. total of 69 hours was used to log the section with the LWD tools. It is believed that the problems to get down with the TLC string was caused by washouts in the Vale formation below the 7/8 shoe. The 7/8 shoe was set to high above the top of Ekofisk Fm due to the discrepancy with the pipe tallies, prior to running the casing (Ref: discussion 12 section). RUNNING LINER. 5373' of 1/2 liner with Weatherford straight aluminum rigid centralizers was ran. The liner started to take some weight after entering the open hole. relatively high running speed had to be used to get the liner to slide in. At 15339' the liner was hanging up and all the weight had to be set down to make it move. It was worked down by high lowering speed and high weight to 15525' were it got stuck. maximum off 200000 lbs oveipull was applied and all string weight was set down on it without success. An attempt was made to circulate without success due to premature setting of the TSP. The packer had prematurely set when attempting to work the liner down (Ref. Nodeco report, Premature setting of TSP packer, File 6-05-2/7B-08A-04). Due to the premature setting of the TSP packer it was required to establish communication at the liner top to be able to cement the liner. Three different options was considered. 1) Wash over the liner top down to the TSP packer with washover mill. This alternative was not selected due to problems to get hold of the required equipment. 2) Perforate the liner in the PBR and have the scab liner seal stem isolate the perforations in the PBR. This option was not selected due to the risk of shouting through both the 1/2 liner and the 7/8 casing. 3) Perforate the liner below the 7/8 shoe and squeeze cement the holes when the cement job was completed. This option was selected. The liner was perforated at 10745' and 10746' and an EZSV was set at 15374'. The liner was cemented trough 7/8 inner string. total of 295 bbls ppg cement slurry was pumped with 75% return. 230 bbls mud cut cement was circulated out from the top off the liner. It is expected that the displacement efficiency is low due to the fact that the liner was not rotated as original planned. Two attempt were made to squeeze of the perforations in the liner without success. total off 40 bbls was squeezed away. After both squeeze jobs the squeeze broke down before reaching 5000 psi test pressure. It was therefore decided to do one more squeeze job and run an Weatherford internal casing patch before doing new attempt to test the liner. page 21total of 346 hrs of down time was logged in conjunction with the squeeze jobs (ref. Downtime analysis below). The perforations was squeezed with 15 bbls cement and the liner was cleaned out to TD. The patch setting area was scraped with casing scraper before the first casing patch was run. The casing patch was spaced out to be set from 10755' to 10735'. Several attempts was made to set the patch without success. The patch slipped and would not set. When trying to go deeper with the patch it stopped at the collar below the perforations. This indicated that the first ft of the patch was expanded and that the setting tool was stroked. It was decided to pull out off hole with the patch, but when the patch entered the joint above it set with the top at 10665' and bottom at 10685'. This could indicate that the joint to be patched had larger ID than nominal. The possible reason for this might be that several cement plugs was drilled out in this area. Two attempts were made to run calliper to confmn the liner ID without success as the calliper could not pass the perforations. No causes has been found to this. The casing patch was then milled and preparations were made to run second patch. The patch length was increased from 20 to 40 ft and the first 5' was double wrapped to ensure good grip in the casing that we considered to be oversized. The first run with the patch was misrun due to the setting tool being plugged with settled Barite. On the second run everything went as planned until the first 15 ft of the patch was set. After 15 ft the cone and collet (expanding assembly) got stuck. 70000-110000 lbs overpull was applied to pull the assembly through the patch without success. It was decided to back out of the setting assembly and to go back in with fishing assembly. On surface the lower polishrod connection was found to be stripped out of the extension bar. An attempt to screw back into the fish was made without success. The setting tool (Cone and collet assembly) was pushed down and it was decided to mill the patch. cement plug was placed across the patch before the patch was milled. The setting tool was retrieved with overshot. For the first patch it is reasons to believe that the problems was caused by the joint to be patched had larger ID than nominal. The possible reason for this might be that several cement plugs was drilled out in this area. For the second patch the problems can have been caused by junk jammed between the patch and the liner. It can also been caused by some mechanical damage to liner joint or collar. (Ref. Weatherford job report and summary for internal casing patch job 2/7B-08A , File 6-05-2/7B-08A-04) page 22DOWNTIME ANALYSIS. Below is the downtime in this part of the operation listed.

PERFORATION AND STIMULATION ANALYSISEXECUTIVE SUMMARY. The perforation and stimulation objectives for the well 2/7 B-08A was to rig up snubbing unit and perform the perforating and stimulation program in one phase in days. total of 6,8 days were actually used. The 2/7 B-08A highly deviated and horizontal well was completed as commingled Ekofisk and Tor producer, with 6 perforation intervals in Ekofisk and 16 perforation intervals in Tor. The well was perforated and stimulated in one phase by the following method: With Dolphin snubbing unit rigged up inside the derrick, the well was tubing conveyed perforated with Halliburton 3/8, SPF, 60 phasing, wt HMX DP LD TCP guns. The well was acid stimulated using ball sealers. In order to optimize the stimulation and be able to break down all the perforation intervals at the same pressure, all the intervals were placed in good porosity zones and 10% acetic acid was pumped down and placed in the liner prior to the perforation. Major achievements: This was the first time in the perforating of the horizontal wells, only one TDF was used on each gun section, all 22 guns fired (approximately 55,000 USD saved). Major operational problems: Not able to pull the protector sleeve with the protector sleeve running tool. Had to get sub type nut for the spear from town to be able to make up the spear to the string. The sleeve was engaged with the spear and pulled with 80 klbs overpull. Step 1: Rig up and pressure test snubbing equipment. Objective : To rig up and pressure test the snubbing equipment in 52 hrs. Conclusions : Time spent was hrs. Had problem to get good teston one of the valves downstream the choke manifold, the valve was replaced with low torque valve. The hydraulic hoses to the automatic choke valve on the choke line were hooked up wrong. The valve was closed when it should be open, the kill and choke line valves had to be retested. Recommendation : The rig choke manifold must be tested prior to the snubbing equipment being shipped offshore (as per the procedure). All valves and hoses needs to be properly marked. Step 2, 3, and 5: SIR, perforate 22 intervals, SOOH and rig down the snubbing equipment. To make up perforating guns, SIH, apply pressure and perforate 22 intervals from 11 90 ft MD RKB and SOOH in 73 hrs. The operations were concluded in hrs; 22,5 hours non productive time was reported. The boom on the platform crane hit ladder in the derrick, bolts from the ladder broke and one bolt hit one of the snubbing crew in the shoulder. Unable to pull the protector sleeve with the protector sleeve running tool, max pull 25 klbs, work free with 45 klbs down weight. Ordered sub type nut from onshore for the spear, to be able to make it up to the string. While waiting for the equipment, jet washed across the protector sleeve. SIR with 1/4 spear with grapple, engaged sleeve and pulled free with 80 klbs overpull. The protector sleeve was modified type with threads in the bottom, which leads to reduced wall thickness. The no-go on top of the sleeve was deformed on the lower mm, so it looks like the protector sleeve was forced down into the nipple. When attempting to pull, the running tool deformed the protector sleeve in the reduced wall thickness area and forced it against the bore of the TRDHSV. 1. For snubbing operation use standard protector sleeve with full wall thickness in the bottom. Have sub nut for the spear available offshore.Step 6: R/U and frac / stimulate formation. To rig up, pressure test lines, stimulate well and install cap on X-mas tree in 10 hrs. No problems occurred during this phase. 17.5 hrs was used on the operation (Vestfonn was not alongside the platform before all the snubbing equipment was rigged down).PERFORATION AND STIMULATION WORK PERFORMANCE PLANNING & MONITORING SYSTEM Well 2/7-B-08A, Eldtisk Field, North Sea Non-productive Time analysis Perforation and stimulation.
