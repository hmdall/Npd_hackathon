Appendices: 1: First arrival picking 2: Sonic log calibration procedure 3: VSP deconvolution 4: Derivation of transposed display The data was acquired in two runs by Read Well Services(runl) and Schlumberger(run2) January 14th and 15th 1996. The survey consisted of Normal Incidence VSP shot from 4902 to 1000 m (MD RICB) and Rig Source VSP shot from 4902 to 1840 (MD RICB). The receiver array consisted of main tool and satellites in runl and single tool in run 2, each containing component geophone cartridge.Thus 4(run2; 1) levels were acquired simultaneous- ly. The seismic source employed for the Normal Incidence VSP were 2x150 cu.in. Sleeve guns and for the Rig Source VSP were 3x150 cu.in. Sleeve guns, depth m., air pressure 2000 psi. The near field monitor hydrophone was kept at an offset of for the N.I.VSP and for the R.S. VSP. Further details are to be found in the section Field Operations Report.

Editing, stacking and timing of data The component geophone data was displayed at large scale and each component edited. The in- dividual near field monitor records were timed to main peak and the corresponding geophone trac- es shifted by this time. It was found that this system delay was stable during the survey at 16 ms +/ - ms for the wireline run, 110 ms +/- ms for the N.I. TLC run and 56 ms +/- ms for the R.S. TLC run. Data in each level was aligned by maximizing the cross-correlation inside window after first break: the data was resampled to 1/4 ms for this purpose. The geophone data was then stacked using median algorithm. summary of the traces included in the stacks at each level, the system delays and residual alignment delays are contained in the Stack Reports. The first arrival time was taken as the top of the first peak: this corresponds to 'trough-to-trough' picking.The reader is referred to Appendix 1: First Arrival Picking for full discussion of this pro- cess. 216 N.I. VSP levels and 180 R.S. VSP levels were recorded on the way up. 204 levels were included in the check shot report and 205(due to double level) in the N.I. VSP processing. Only 191 levels were included in the sonic calibration. The deepest levels were not in- cluded in the sonic calibration to avoid non-unique time-depth relation. Saga Petroleum a.s.; 34/7-P-32 PageCheck shot computations, calibration of Sonic Logs Using the first arrival values picked above, and information on survey geometry, the Check Shot Report was produced. Details of the computations and results are included in this section. The sonic, density, gamma ray and caliper logs were read from tape supplied by the client, then edited after consultations with the client. Details of editing are to be found on the side label of the Calibrated Sonic Log (Enclosures Al and A2). After careful examination of the calculated drift be- tween the integrated sonic log and check shot values, drift corrections were applied to the sonic log. Details of these drift corrections are given at the beginning of the Calibrated Sonic Log. The logs themselves are displayed at two scales, 1:1000 (Enclosure Al) and 1:500 (Enclosure A2). These show the uncalibrated and calibrated sonic logs, density log, raw integrated sonic time, calibrated integrated sonic time and check shot information. The reader is refered to Appendix 2: 'Sonic Log calibration procedure'. The calibrated sonic log now provides unique time / depth relationship over the entire logged in- terval, together with velocity information. The logs were then resampled to the time domain, at ms TWT sample interval. Using the velocity and density logs, an acoustic impedance log, reflec- tion coefficient series and transmission loss log were calculated. listing of these logs is provided in the section lime Domain Velocity Report. Velocity and density models were made above the logs: details of these are to be found on the side label of the Synthetic Seismograms (Enclosures A4 to A7). Two suites of synthetic seismograms are shown, (A4 and A6) using Ricker wavelets, (A5 and A7) using Butterworth wavelets. The calibrated velocity log is presented with linear time scales of 10 cm/s and 20 cm/s for direct comparison with the surface seismic. ('Velocity Log - Lin- ear Time Scale': Enclosures A3 and A3a) VSP Processing Sequence(VVireline run) Data in the interval 0 MD RICB was used in the Normal Incidence VSP processing for the wireline run( run 1). TRANSMISSION LOSS COMPENSATION Energy loss of the direct arrival is compensated for by normalizing the data in 40 ms window after the first arrival. single scalar is applied to each trace to force the RMS amplitude in this window to unity.

SPHERICAL DIVERGENCE COMPENSATION The loss of energy due to spherical divergence is compensated for by applying the scalar Si to sam- ple i, where Si = (Ti / TO) ** and Ti is the time of sample i, TO the first arrival time, and data dependant parameter in the range to 1.5., in this case 1.4. WAVEFIELD TRANSPOSITION This process moves data from the deconvolved Upgoing wavefield which lies directly under the first break line to the 'near trace' of the output. The length of the time window on each trace is de- fined as the FTB difference between the neighbouring traces. The algorithm used is described in more detail in Appendix 4.

VSP Test processing(Wireline run) The following steps in the processing have been tested: WA'VEF1ELD SEPARATION, (Display Ti, section 2) The Downgoing wavefield is computed from the normalized aligned stack with median filter. 5, 7, and 11 points median filters were tested. The Downgoing wavefield is subtracted from the total wavefield to give the Upgoing wavefield. By inspection of these Upgoing Wavefield and frequency domain plots, points median filter was chosen for the wavefield separation. VSP DECONVOLUTION, (Display T2, section 2) The operator is computed from the Downgoing wavefield (Panel B, Display B2). The design win- dow was defined as 1200 ms by inspecting the multiple energy. The low cut (8 Hz) in the Butter- worth filter that is defined as 'Desired Output' is taken from the FZ- and FK-plots (See enclosures). Different High-cuts were tested (40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 Hz). These tests together with the FK plot conclude that 90 Hz high cut gives the optimum VSP result. NOISE REJECIION MEDIAN FILTER, (display 1'3 and T4, section 2), Different median filters (3, and points) were tested on the deconvolved Upgoing wavefield. These filters will enhance and smooth all events that are horizontal in two way travel time and sup- press all other events. The longer the filters are and the more an event dips the more the event will be suppressed. By subtracting the enhanced deconvolved Upgoing wavefield from the raw decon- volved wavefield 'Residual-Residual' wavefield is produced. These Wavefield will contain the events that has been suppressed in the median filtering, like dipping events, reflections from fault- planes, converted Shear waves etc. point median filter was chosen for the enhancement of the Upgoing Wavefield and for the residual-residual display.VSP Processing Sequence(TLC run) Data in the interval 7 MD RICB was used in the Normal Incidence VSP processing for the TLC run( run 2).

Merge of Wireline and TLC data: The two datasets were processed individually up to the final displays. For each of the final displays traces 1-94 from the TLC run were merged together with traces 1-111 from the wireline run. The total number of traces for the merged dataset is 205. Display B5-B8(Final Upwaves) and I1-I3(Interpreters Composite) contain corridor stacks made only from the wireline data. Corridor stacks were made only from the Wireline data, because the wavefield separation for the TLC run was not successful.INTERPRETER'S COMPOSITE DISPLAYS Enclosures Ii to 13 are Minimum Phase composite displays of the available Well Seismic data, con- sisting of the following: -Side label with acquisition and processing parameters for the VSP, synthetic seismograms and stir face seismic data - Linear two way time scale; Depth scale below MSL - Velocity, Density, Reflection coefficients, Transmission Losses, and Acoustic Impedance log - Gamma ray - Synthetic seismogram, 8-50 Hz MPH - Corridor stack from Zero Offset VSP - 50 Hz MPH(Wireline only) - Corridor stack from Transposed VSP - 50 Hz MPH(Wireline only) - Synthetic seismogram, 8-90 Hz MPH - Corridor stack from Zero Offset VSP - 90 Hz MPH(Wireline only) - Corridor stack from Transposed VSP - 90 Hz MPH(Wireline only) - The surface seismic random line - The surface seismic random line with the N.I.

Page 10Appendix : First Arrival Picking FIRST ARRIVAL PICKING 1. INTRODUCTION The two methods commonly employed to pick first arrival times from VSP data are 'trough-to-trough' and 'break-to-break' measurements. The terms trough and break refer to the part of the waveform on the near field monitor trace and the vertical component geophone trace which are picked. Both these methods have their supporters in oil com- panies, and both are justified by theoretical and practical considerations. The decision about which to use rests with the client, and will generally be based on company policy in this matter, the method used in nearby wells, and to some extent data quality. The soft- ware in use at READ Well Services allows both methods to be used. Section outlines the theoretical problems about choice of first arrival picking method. It concludes that trough-to-trough measurements will probably give the best 'tie' be- tween the VSP and surface seismic data sets, due to the inescapable dispersive and ab- sorptive nature of the earth. From practical viewpoint alone, trough to trough picking is preferable for the following reasons: 1. The trough pick can be made with much greater accuracy, the timing of local mini- mum being virtually indisputable. 2. In the presence of noise, the trough pick is more easily recognizable. Though the pres- ence of noise can alter the timing of trough pick, this can usually be overcome by using an envelope function. 2.0 STANDARD PROCESSING SEQUENCE FOR FIRST ARRIVAL ESTIMATION 2.1 Editing The near field monitor traces and z-component geophone traces are read from field tape, displayed at large scale, and edited. Traces are edited because of: - Electrical noise contamination (50 / 60 Hz) - High frequency noise bursts - / ratio low - Poor clamping However it is important to preserve enough data to produce good stack. The median stacking routine is particularly robust in the presence of noise bursts. level can be com- pletely removed after 1-____ picking (as it is nearly always possible to estimate the FIB),  Appendix : First Arrival Picking - Page of - Mod. 1/18/91so that the bad trace does not affect adjacent levels during wavefield separation 2.2 Near Field Monitor timing There is small, potentially variable time delay from the start of data on tape and the seis- mic energy being released from the source. This is measured by recording near field monitor trace simultaneously with the geophone data. This, in the marine case, is hy- drophone kept at fixed distance from the airgun. The near field hydrophone is timed by a semi-automatic alogrithm. 2.3 Stack of geophone data Fart geophone trace is sub-sample shifted by the value of the corresponding monitor time. The geophone data is now sorted into common level gathers. Optionally, the traces can be aligned by cross-correlation and sub-sample shift technique. The data is then stacked in common level gathers, using the normal average stack or optionally median algorithm. 2.4 Timing of geophone traces This process is done semi-interactively, using blown up view of the first arrival region. After picking is complete, there is optionally an automatic alignment process which can correct the first breaks by cross-correlation of each trace with pilot trace, or by numer- ical smoothing of the arrival times. 2.5 Use of first break information The first break times are transferred to the check shot software for use in producing the check, shot report and calibration of the sonic log. The times are also transferred to the trace headers of the x- and y- geophone components, for use in further processing of three component data. 3.0 BREAK-TO-BREAK vs. TROUGH-TO-TROUGH: THEORY First consider the ideal seismic source: true impulse with flat amplitude spectrum and a zero or linear phase spectrum. The first break and the first trough are the same thing. This source is of course impossible to produce, but source with very short rise time (e.g. dynamite has relatively flat amplitude spectrum from - 200 Hz.) approaches the ideal. The travel time the centre of this impulse characterizes the group velocity of the medium. With an airgun or watergun source, the leading peak of the main energy is also of relatively short duration.Due to the absorptive and dispersive properties of the earth, it is observed in most wells that the time between first break and first trough increases with depth. The first trough, however, still retains its meaning as travel time characteristic of the group velocity of the medium. The first break, however, will characterize the arrival of the various phase velocities. The position of the first break in time will depend on the amplitude and gain downhole. Higher frequencies will be detectable with higher gain. In the presence of broad band noise, detectability becomes yet more complex problem. 'Minimum phase' interpretation of surface seismic data deals essentially with breaks, though velocity analysis deals essentially with peaks and troughs (though at much lower resolution). The timing of identifiable events on the surface seismic will thus be break measurement. The 'tie' between the VSP and the surface seismic will depend on both data sets having the same temporal bandwidth. This can be ananged by using the same deconvolution and bandpass filter parameters on the VSP as were used on the surface seismic. If the surface seismic is 'zero phase', this will often mean, in the marine case, that some sort of phase correction process has been run on the data. similar process can be applied to the VSP data set. One important use of check shot data is the calibration of sonic logs. The sonic log is re- corded with single ultra-sonic sound pulse ( ca. 25 kHz. ), and the transit time measured by the signal crossing detection threshold. The threshold varies according to the signal- to-noise conditions at the receiver, and although some adjustment is made, the 'pick' is neither first break nor first trough. The single frequency means there will be no disper- sion, and there is relatively little absorption over the short travel path. The well geophone data includes possibly dispersive and certainly absorptive effect better estimated by the trough-to-trough method and not removed by picking break-to- break. Thus by calibrat- ing the sonic log with trough-to-trough picked check shot values, the synthetic seismo- gram will have included in it the effects of dispersion and absorption. This will then tie well with the surface seismic data. Sonic derived interval velocities are often used for quite detailed formation analysis, and in these cases it is wise to investigate the way in which the sonic log has been calibrated.Appendix: VSP Deconvolution DECONVOLUTION DURING VSP PROCESSING 1.0 SOURCE SIGNATURE DECONVOLUTION In some situations it may be necessary to perform source signature deconvolution on the data set before stack. This occurs when there is significant variation in the source signa- ture from shot to shot, caused by large variations in gun depth, variation in the pressure of the air supplied to the gun, or with sources consisting of several guns, failure of the synchronization system. In these situations, the geophone traces will be potentially dis- similar, and cannot be stacked without severe loss of signal quality. Source signature deconvolution is performed by designing filter which shapes each near field hydrophone signal into suitable standard output wavelet (e.g. bandlimited spike), and applying this filter to the corresponding geophone trace. Another technique which can be applied to cases where the source signature varies, but is still essentially minimum phase, is predictive deconvolution using window from the geophone trace alone. Software for performing both these types of deconvolution is in available at RWS. It should be noted that the near field hydrophone data is usually not of the same quality as the geophone data. The severe operating environment requires an instrument built for robustness rather than high fidelity. The signal is also dominated by high frequencies which do not penetrate the earth to the geophones. Hence it is recommended to employ a gun flotation system, good air supply, and reliable gun control system to ensure re- peatable source signature. Then the source signature may be removed from the data to- gether with downgoing multiples during the VSP deconvolution process. 2.0 VSP DECONVOLUTION In order to remove the downgoing multiple response and source signature from the up- going wavefield, there are two main options available: Deterministic deconvolution: This is applicable to zero offset, vertical incidence, and with less accuracy to offset geometries. The assumption is that measured upgoing wave- field is the convolution of the reflection series beneath the geophone with the downgoing wavefield measured at the geophone. Thus if we design filter which collapses the mea- sured downgoing wavefield to bandlimited spike, applying the filter to the measured up- going wavefield will produce the bandlimited reflection coefficient series beneath the geophone. The window input to the Wiener filter will be chosen to include significant multiples. In the case of offset geometries, the main assumption made above is invalid, as the downgoing energy has different ray-path to the upgoing at given receiver. How- ever, as many of the multiples are in fact short period and generated in the near surface Appendix : VSP Deconvolution - Page of - Mod. 2/16/90region, where the ray paths are not significantly different, applying deterministic decon- volution with short input window may prove effective. An alternative is predictive deconvolution. This process, while effective on surface seis- mic data, is for VSP inferior to the deterministic method described above. This is because no assumptions are made in the deterministic method about the nature of the source or the reflectors. In predictive deconvolution, the assumptions made are that the reflection series is 'white', and that the source signature is minimum phase. The method is applica- ble to situations where the up- and downgoing ray paths differ significantly, and may be used in combination with deterministic approach. Software to perform both these types of deconvolution, together with an sophisticated wavelet analysis package, are available at RWS. The software is sufficiently flexible to allow deconvolution operators to be designed, processed independently and stored for use as required in either other stages of the VSP processing, or on other data sets. RWS has experience in die reprocessing of surface seismic data employing VSP derived de- convolution operators. Appendix: VSP Deconvolution - Page of - Mod. 2/16/90Sonic log calibration procedure 1.0 INTRODUCTION The sonic log, acoustic log, or continuous velocity log (CVL), is standard log used by log analysts to help determine formation porosity and for correlation purposes. The log is used by the geophysicist to help determine an accurate and detailed time- depth curve from datum to the total depth of the well. The sonic log is also used to create model for preparing synthetic seismograms. The sonic log measures the acoustic velocity of the formation over one or two foot inter- vals using ultrasonic energy. Errors occur in the log due to borehole conditions or instru- ment instability. Comparison of the integrated sonic log time and the interval times obtained from the check shot survey over sections of the borehole allows the sonic log to be calibrated to give times compatable with surface seismic data. The assumption normal- ly made in the calibration procedure is that the check level data is correct and that the son- ic log is in error. 2.0 USES OF CALIBRATED SONIC LOGS 1. Accurate time to depth conversion for help in interpreting seismic sections. The two way travel time log with the velocity values resampled at equal travel time intervals is of- ten used for direct correlation with seismic sections. 2. Synthetic Seismogram generation. The reflection coefficient series is computed from the velocity log ( and density log if available ) sampled in time. synthetic seismogram is generated from the reflection coefficient series by filtering with wavelet similar in form to the seismic source. Multiple reflections and transmission loss effects can also be mod- elled using the reflection coefficient series. The most useful synthetic seismogram models primaries without transmission losses, this representing the ideal response expected on the seismic section at the well location. 3. Raw sonic logs can be corrected to gain more accurate in situ velocities. This aids in correlation in areas where local effects cause the recorded interval transit time to vary from well to well in the same lithological units. 3.0 PROBLEMS USING THE UNCALIBRATED SONIC LOG The basic principle of the sonic log is to measure the time taken by the ultrasonic pulse be- tween two receivers in the dovvnhole tool, seperated one or two feet apart. The result is plotted as log of interval transit time ( usually in microseconds per foot ). This is equiva- lent to inverse velocity. By integrating the log, total travel time (11) over the logged in- terval can be obtained. This is not usually adequate, however, for detailed studies and the log requires calibration.Appendix: Sonic Log Calibration The types of problem which occur with the sonic logs are most commonly either cycle skips, when one receiver fails to detect the true first arrival of the ultrasonic signal, or washouts, where the first arrival has been transmit- ted through the fluid column and not the formation. These types of errors can often be recognised, but cycle skip, in particular, is not obvious if the log has been filtered or is playback. Editing of known errors can remove some of these problems but not all. In the case of washouts, for example, the true formation velocity may not be known accurately. Mother problem for the geophysicist is that the velocities measured by the sonic log are often different from seismic velocities, which are obtained by a study of acoustic waves of much greater wavelength. This can be attribut- ed to either the different ways of timing the sonic log waveforms and the seismic check shot arrivals, or to genuine velocity dispersion between the different frequencies. In addition, de-stressing or fluid invasion of the bore- hole wall caused by drilling may alter its acoustic properties. Lastly the sonic log rarely is made up to surface, and thus the velocity in this upper zone is unknown. The absolute travel time to particular depth is therefore not certain. 4.0 CHECK SHOT CALIBRATION Most of these problems can be removed by checkshot calibration. Check- shot calibration is performed in two stages: 1. Tying the log time (T1) with the check shot time (Tc)at specific depth to give an absolute time below datum. This is done using single check shot value. Thus it is fixed that travel time is associated with depth D. 2. Modifying the recorded values so that the integrated travel times from the calibrated log are equal to the interval times from the checicshot levels. Stage is not so simple. It is possible to adjust the log so that all values over given section are changed by few microseconds per foot. This is known as linear shift and is usually applied when the velocities from the sonic log are too high. The assumption made is that the log is in error by constant amount at each reading. An alternative method of modifying log velocities is called differential shift and is usually applied when the log velocities are considered too low. In this case the error is often in low velocity values caused by washouts. To compensate, the low velocities are adjusted more than high velocities. The different types of shifts are discussed in more detail in chapter 4.2. Appendix: Sonic Log Calibration- Page of - Mod. June 30, 19934.1 THE CALIBRATION CURVE An example is given in Fig 1. To display the relationship between check level times and integrated sonic log times, cal- ibration curve is produced. This is plot of true vertical depth against the difference be- tween integrated log time and check level time at each check level depth( TVD vs Ti-Tc)). The sonic log integrator is time-fled to the corrected time of the shallowest check level in- cluded in the depth range covered by the log. Then the first point on the calibration curve has ITI-Tc' value of zero. From the calibration curve, single or series of drift 'shifts' will be indicated by the points implying that the velocities require correction. The points will define both the direction and the magnitude of the shift to be applied to the velocity log. The shifts can be applied from check level to check level but are more often interpolated to change at significant changes of velocity and/or lithology. The danger of not changing drift at significant boundaries is of changing the local character of the log and introducing artificial velocity interfaces. By changing at the ends of lithological units, the reasonable assumption is made that the source of the error is related to lithology. 4.2 TYPES OF SHIFT It is common practice to apply: 1. linear shift to lower velocities 2. differential shift to higher velocities In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to apply: 3. linear shift to higher velocities 4. differential shift to lower velocities 5. continuously varying shift 4.2.1 Linear Shifts to Lower Velocities A shift to lower velocities is defined by points drifting to the left with increasing depth on the calibration curve. In this the log velocities are recorded to high, the log interval times are smaller, and the Tl-Tc curve decreases. Shifts to lower velocities are normally applied linearly, where each inverse velocity sam- ple receives constant correction in terms of inverse velocity. Linear shifts are calculated using the following formula: Shift = Ta / ( D2-D1 ) where D1 = Log depth at upper change of shift D2 = Log depth at lower change of shift Ta = Total time to be 'added' to log between depths D1 and D2, ie. Ta = (Tl-Tc) at depth D1 - (Tl-Tc) at depth D2 Linear shifts are expressed in terms of the value by which each inverse velocity sample is shifted. E.g. mics/ft. shift to lower velocities. 4.2.2 Differential Shifts to higher velocities A shift to higher velocities is defined by the points on the calibration curve drifting to the right with increasing depth. The log velocities recorded are too low and hence the interval firms of the log are greater than those obtained from check shot data. This results in TI- Tc increase.A shift to higher velocities is normally applied 'differentially', which re- sults in lower velocity sections of the log receiving larger inverse velocity correction than the higher velocity sections. The assumption here is that the lower velocity sections contribute the majority of errors due to borehole conditions. Differential shifts are calculated using the formula: Shift = ((t241 ) - tr ) / ( t2 - ti ) where ti = Log time at upper change of shift t2 = Log time at lower change of shift tr = Time to be 'removed' from log, ie. (fl-To) at depth D2 - (T1-Tc) at depth DI. The application of differential shift has the effect of reducing the velocity interfaces within the depths covered by the shift. This effect is advanta- geous if the character of the log is preserved in areas where washouts have caused very low log velocities. The formula to calculate differential shifts may be modified to restrict shift at user-defined inverse velocity 'base- line'. This would mean that the low velocity sections receive large veloc- ity correction and log recorded at or faster than the velocity defined by the shift baseline remains unshifted. Differential shift slopes appear non-linear when plotted on the calibration curve. For example, if shift zone covers section where the velocity moves from generally low velocity to generally high velocity, the cali- bration curve will 'bend', with the majority of the shift concentrated on the lower velocity section. Care should therefore be taken when applying dif- fential shifts. 4.23 Linear Shifts to higher velocities This may be considered when then-To curve lies on linear trend, and there is no evidence of washouts. This type of correction assumes the error to be due to some constant tying difference between the check shot data and the sonic log data, or in constant velocity zones to dispersion effects. 4.24 Differential Shift to lower velocities There are two situations where this may be considered:Appendix : Sonic Log Calibration (a) Gas affected holes. diffential shift to lower velocities will normally mean that the lower velocity sections require larger velocity shift to lower velocities. This is usually due to the presence of gas bearing strata within the borehole which are of such low velocity that the fluid arrival prevents the true formation arrival being timed. (b) differential shift to lower velocities which applies smaller velocity shift to lower velocity sections. This may occur if the borehole is washed out and parts of the sonic log are recorded at artificially low velocities, and thus do not require shift to even lower velocities. In this case shift re- striction baseline would be set at the value of the lower velocity sections and the bulk if the shift would be concentrated on the higher velocity sec- tions. 4.25 Contirtously varying shift A continuously varying shift may be applied to tie the log times to the check shot times. best fit ctuve is used, and its slope in microseconds per foot is applied as continuously varying function. This correction is not re- lated to lithological boundaries, and tends to smear errors over boundaries. The advantage of this method is that it is the best fit curve is well condi- tioned, at no point will the correction be greatly in error. It is applicable where the the Tl-Tc curve shows series of short trends which can not be easily interpreted as either linear or differential shifts. Editing of sonic and density logs Velocity and density logs can be incorrect due to borehole conditions, or acquisition errors, and should be edited before calibration, depth/time con- version and production of synthetic seismograms. READ has the following tools available: , Interactive log editing software  Plots of other logs, eg. caliper, gamma ray, resistivity , Generation of synthetic velocity and density logs from other well logs  Generation of synthetic velocity logs from check shot first arrival times This processing stage is usually done in close cooperation with the client.APPENDIX : DERIVATION OF TRANSPOSED DISPLAYDerivation of Transposed Display input trace 1st window from outcast trace 2nd window from n-1 1st window 2nd window is \ two way time ( ) -ft output trace 13 -0, two way time Figure (VSP Processing Displays Saga Petroleum a.s. 34/7-P-32 CONTENTS: Displays of Normal Incidence VSP - Wireline Run: Rl.
