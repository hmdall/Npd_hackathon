IOANNIDES EPR-E .WA5.82by R. Jan du Chene, M. Pons and N.S. Ioanirddes INTRODUCTION For the paleontological investigation of the Esso 16/7-2 well, 65 cutting samples, 28 sidewall cores and 15 core samples were processed for palynology, and 47 cutting samples and core samples were examined for micropaleontology. In addition, sidewall cores were analyzed geochemically, as requested by Esso Norway (Table 1). Significantly, most of the samples below core (core 4: 2675-2690,75m) and down to the Permo- Triassic section have proved barren and only couple of SWC's yielded dinocyst association certainly not older than Juras- sic. Evidently, there exists the possibility of mud contami- nation but until there is proof to the contrary the proposed interpretation seems the best possible at present. The stratigraphic tops are: Depth Age Palynology Micropaleontology (in m) 600 Pleistocene-Pliocene Elphidium incertum, E. clavatum, Cassidu- lina laevigata 700 Pliocene Cibicides lobatulus grossa 1100 Miocene Good dinos associationDepth Age Palynology Micropaleontology 1400 Late to Middle Zone IX Oligocene 1700 Early Oligocene (?) 1990 Early Oligocene to Late Eocene 2020 Middle Eocene 2080 Early Eocene 2235 Late to Middle Paleocene Zone VII (?)

B - Micropaleontology This sample is characterized by the presence of such forams as Elphidium incertum, E. clavatum and Cassidulina laevigata. From 700 to 1000m: Pliocene Palynomorphs recorded in this interval are not diagnostic. B -Micropaleontology The presence of Cibicides lobatulus grossa at 700m indicates Pliocene age. Elphidium sp. 16, Ammonia beccarii, Nonion pompilioides are additionally observed in this interval.From 1100 to 1300m: Miocene Good dinoflagellate assemblages are recorded throughout this interval: Operculodinium crassum, Hgstrichosphaeridium choanophorum, Tectatodinium pellitum, Hgstrichokolpoma rigau- dae, Palaeocgstodinium golzowense, Hgstrichosphaeropsis ovum, H. obscurum, Apteodinium spiridioides, Pentadinium taeniagerum, Nillioudodinium tenuitabulatum, Tuberculodinium van campoae, Cgclopsiella elliptica, Andalusiella sp., etc... A Miocene foram assemblage is present at 1300m. Asterigerina staeschei and A. gurichi are the most prominent species ; they are accompanied by Globorotalia scitula and Gr. obesa. From 1400 to 1600m: Late to Middle Oligocene At 1500m the first occurrence of Deflandrea phosphoritica, Deflandrea heterophlgcta and Wetzeliella spp. indicates Late to Middle Oligocene age (Zone IX). At 1600m, we recorded Rhombodinium draco, Wetzeliella sgm- metrica and Tangosphaeridium paradoxum which characterize zone VIII. Other dinocysts present in these samples are: Chiropteridium dispersum, Ch. aspinatum, Heteraulacacgsta sp., Palaeocgsto- dinium golzowense, Andalusiella sp., Cordosphaeridium cantha- rellum, Thalassiphora pelagica.At 1400m, the presence of arenaceous foraminifera with Cyclam- mina aff. placenta suggest an Oligocene age. Radiolarians and rare Turrilina alsatica are also observed in this interval. From 1700 to 1990m: Early Oligocene to Late Eocene This assemblage is characterized by the presence of Areosphae- ridium arcuatum, A. diktgoplokus and Kisselovia coleothrypta (Zone VII). single specimen of Eatonicysta ursulae (Zone V) is recorded at 1900m and considered reworked. The microfauna is represented by Cgclammina aff. cancellata, C. placenta, Ammodiscus incertus, Bathgsiphon discreta, Tro- chammina globigeriniformis and other arenaceous foraminifera. Glomospira charoides is observed from 1900m downwards. From 2020 to 2050m: Middle Eocene The first occurrence of Wetzeliella articulata at 2020m indi- cates Middle Eocene age, (Zone VI). Wetzeliella pachgderma and Eatonicgsta ursulae which characterize zone V, are absent from this interval.Foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by arenaceous forams. Incertae sedis organism is present at 2020m and below. single specimen of Coscinodiscus sp. is observed at 2050m, but considered reworked. From 2080 to 2230m: Early Eocene The association W. pachyderma and Kisselovia aff. clathrata present from 2080 to 2140m characterizes the zone IV. Deflandrea speciosa which indicates the zone III, is abundant at 2170 and persists down section. The ratio of pollen is increasing in this zone: disaccate pollen, Carya type, Taxo- diaceae type. At 2170m, Coscinodiscus sp. is recorded together with rare Globigerina linaperta. The microfaunal assemblage is always represented by arenaceous foraminifera. From 2235 to 2315m: Late to Middle Paleocene Alisocysta circumtabulata is consistently present from 2235m, and indicates the IB zone. Zone II seems to be absent.Other dinoflagellates characterizing this interval are: Tha- lassiphora delicata, Cordosphaeridium fibrospinosum, C. modes, Achomosphaera sagena, A. alcicornu, A. crassipellis, Hgstri- chosphaeridium tubiferum, Oligosphaeridium sp., Areoligera senonensis, Spiniferites spp., Caligodinium sp. A few specimens of Palaeoperidinium pgrophorum are considered reworked. From 2300 to 2315m, P. pgrophorum is still rare but occurs consistently. This interval may represent transition zone between IB and IA2. Bolivinopsis spectabilis is observed at 2240m and the micro- fauna is the same as above. From 2315 to 2378.8m: Middle to Early Paleocene The regular occurrence of Palaeoperidinium pgrophorum characte- rizes this interval and defines the zone IA2. Other dinocysts are: Palaeocgstodinium benjaminii, H. tubiferum, T. delicata, A. sagena, etc... The fragment of E. crassibulata recorded at 2424m, is considered reworked. Arenaceous foraminifera are again present. At 2338m, Globoro- talia compressa and Globigerina spp. appear. These forms indicate Middle to Early Paleocene age. The core at 2375m.50 is barren of microfossils.- 10 - From 2424m to 2425.7m: Early Paleocene Palynology The occurrence of abundant Eisenackia crassitabulata indicates the zone IAl. From 2479 to 2539m: Early Maastrichtian One specimen of Litosphaeridium cf. arundum is present in sample 2485m, indicating generalized Middle to Late Cre- taceous age. B - MkropaleontAogy At 2479m the presence of Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis, Predico- sphaera cretacea, Kamptnerius magnificus, Cretarhabdus crenula- tus, Micula staurophora suggests an Early Maastrichtian age. From 2539 to 2560m : Early Maastrichtian to Late Campanian Micropaleontology At 2539m, the association of Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis and Reinhardtites anthophorus indicates an Early Maastrichtian to Late Campanian age.At 2560m: Campanian to Santonian At 2560m, it is difficult to assign more precise age to this sample than Campanian to Santonian. Eiffellithus eximius is observed in association with Reinhardtites anthophorus. From 2587 (as high as 2581m) to 2675m: Early Kimmeridgian to Oxfordian Although drastic change in organic matter (from woody into an abundance of amorphous) occurs at 2581m, the first positively identified Jurassic palynomorphs are observed at 2587m and become more diversified below but always badly diluted by the organic matter. These include Gongaulacgsta jurassica, Scri- niodinium luridum, Scriniodinium cf. galleritum, Sirmiodinium grossii, Acanthaulax sp. and variety of Millioudodinium spp. An early Kimmeridgian to Oxfordian age may be suggested. It is worth noting that in sample at 2587m Palaeohgstrichophora infusoroides, and Criboperidinium spp. are present; they are almost certainly caved from higher in the section and indicate that Campanian (or older) rocks were penetrated. The remote possibility of having Cretaceous sequence with reworked Jurassic should be born in mind. From 2675 to 2683m: Callovian A highly distinctive assemblage was extracted from the upper half of core which spans the above interval. In addition to- 12 - Gongaulacgsta jurassica and Sirmiodinium grossii, it contains common Ctenidodinium tenellum/stauromatos, Lithodinia spp, Pareodinia ceratophora, Ellipsoidictyrum sp., Meiourogonyaulax sellwoodii, and Tubotuberella eisenacki subsp. oligodentata. Rare reworked striate pollen are also present. Callovian age is indicated. From 2683 to 2975m: Tentatively Jurassic (not older than Callovian ?) The samples prepared from this interval are barren or poor in recovery. Millioudodinium is seen scarcely, and it is associa- ted with Scriniodinium crystallinum and Scriniodinium? luridum. A level of reference may be considered the SWC at 2903m which contains Gonyaulacysta jurassica, Meiourogonyaulax cf. valensi, Leptodinium cf. subtile and S.? luridum. On the basis of the above assemblage an age not older than Callovian is tentatively suggested. However, the penetration of red beds in this interval, generally indicative of an older age (Triassic), would require further evidence for substan- tiating the in situ occurrence of the forementioned palyno- morphs. It should be emphasized here that problems of this nature may only be solved by the use of conventional cores. It is of interest that similar situation occurred in the 16/9-1 well (1968) where possibly comparable interval was not differentiated at that time despite the presence of Gonyaula- cysta jurassica (recycling may have then been suspected too). One of us rapidly re-examined some of the SWC's between 7750' and 8070' in 16/9-1. Millioudodinium and other elements not older than Jurassic were also observed. Unfortunately core proved barren of microfossils (core 2: approx. 7860'-7867').- 13 - From 2975 to 3003m: Permo-Triassic Striate pollen are consistently encountered in this interval. A Permo-Triassic age is suggested. From 3003 to 3146m: Permo-Triassic Questionable Lueckisporites virkkiae is present at 3003m, accompanied by other striate bisaccate pollen. Monosaccate pollen attributable to Potoneisporites and Florinites are commonly represented. Permian age is indicated. GEOCHEMISTRY It is of interest to note that the sample at 2581m is conside- rably richer in organic matter than the underlying four samples. Although thermally immature, the type of organic matter (predominantly type I) enhances its value as source rock. The four samples between 2975.20m and 3033m fall within the oil window despite the limited, and essentially gaz prone organic matter (predominently type III).
