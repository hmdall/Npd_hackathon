Thus having some logistical challenges in the planning phase, having enough bentonite was not an issue. The well was spudded at 04:30 hrs on 17th October 2019 and the section drilled riser-less with returns to seabed. Due to boulders the initial was drilled at / hr before drilling the rest of the section to TD of 331 in 10 hours. Seawater was used while drilling with Hi-Vis Bentonite sweeps pumped at regular intervals. These sweeps were pumped 15 m3 every half stand, leaving 15 m3 around BHA during connection. Drilled to TD at 330 with an average ROP of +/- 4m/hr and 4500 lpm. At TD two 20 m3 sweeps were pumped and the open hole was displaced to 58 m3 of 1.30 sg KCl/GEM/POLYMER WBM. Prior to pulling above seabed, the well was topped up with further 10 m3 of sg KCl/GEM/POLYMER WBM. 30 conductor was run and cemented to 330 without any issues. The Bentonite Sweeps performed as expected during the section and no issues were encountered. Drill water was tested regularly prior to building sweep mud and chlorides were consistently below 350 mg/l. No signs of poor hole cleaning or issues running conductor.

All Rights Reserved Page 33 of 1625.3.1.1 Halliburton Drilling Services - 1/2 hole Objective The main objective for this hole section was to investigate the presence of hydrocarbons in the primary target Rogn Fm. This hole section was drilled in runs. First run drilled to core point at 1669 m, interrupted by rig repair of nearly days. The second run cored the interval 1669 to 1687 and the last run drilled to well TD at 1775 m. After wire line logging the well was plugged and abandoned by setting cement plugs from TD and back into the 5/8 casing at 925 m. Run Summary 8 1/2 hole to core point A PDC bit was run on rotary assembly incorporating full MWD suite. The bit was washed down from 984 and tagged top of cement at 1018 m. Drilled shoe track and hard cement while displacing to sg OBM. Cleaned out rat hole and drilled of new formation to 1059 m. Confirmed even in/out mud weights and pulled back into the 5/8 casing shoe. total of 38 cement/plugs were drilled in hours and krevs. A FIT was performed successfully to sg. Drilling of 1/2 hole section continued with 2000 lpm and 120 rpm to 1098 with penetration rates limited to 110 m/hr until BHA out of casing. Increased ROP to mph from 1098 to 1472 m, parameters 2200 lpm and rpm. Drilled 1/2 section to 1553 with 200 m/hr, downlinked to set XBAT in real time mode and continued with reduced ROP 60 m/hr. At connection depth 1564 the draw works wires slacked-off and the complete weight of the top drive was set on the stick-up. While making repairs circulation was carried out via the cement hose and down the string at up to 1200 lpm at intermittent intervals. The well was displaced from to sg before pulling out to inside the 5/8 shoe to continue repairs and test the top drive. Repair was completed and the bit run back to bottom. Drilling resumed with 30 m/hr progress, 2000 lpm and 160 rpm. The bit drilled to 1669 and circulated bottoms up for cuttings samples. This depth was set as coring point. The hole was circulated clean by bottoms up. Flow checked the well to be static and pulled stands wet. A slug was pumped and the bit was pulled out of hole, flow checking in casing shoe and prior to pulling the BHA into the BOP. BHA was in good condition.

The INNOVERT NS YELLOW OBM from Infill was treated back into spec prior to this operation with good success. The OBM performed as expected and not much treatment was needed while drilling- stable parameters the entire section. OWR stayed steady throughout drilling and so did the Fluid loss. Rheology went down on the low end, but still within spec. Added BARAVIS 568 and some BDF 919 to the active system enhanced the Rheology spec. No new SOURSCAV was added for this reservoir section, however we continued to add BARACARB50 (approx sack pr stand) throughout the section to maintain the tight fluid loss and strengthen the wellbore. A FIT was performed to 1.63sg and new formation was drilled to 1564m MD/TVD. Issues with topdrive lead to stop in drilling and the mud system was weighed up to sg due to not having riser margin. Once topdrive was fixed the drilling continued to first coring point, and wireline was run. Not able to pass restrictions at 1519m after several attempts. Decided to proceed with P&A. Observed excellent hole cleaning with ROP at 250 m/hr with rpm-readings at 10. The sudden topdrive repair in conjunction with fast drilling (high amounts of cuttings in hole) did not cause any issues when starting up again. The riser was boosted and the rheology was kept in excellent shape throughout the section. All in all, the mud performed excellent throughout the static period while fixing the top drive, several attempts to run WL and while drilling. No signs of unstable parameters were seen, nor hole issues encountered.

All Rights Reserved Page 38 of 162Mud Density The section was displaced to sg INNOVERT NS YELLOW, however the decision was made to weight up the active system to sg during the top drive repair due to not having riser margin. Barite was used to weight up with no issues, and the wellbore showed no signs of having instability issues. Once the top drive was repaired the section was drilled to TD with sg OBM. Rheology Rheology was in the middle range of the spec throughout the drilling (9 on dial), and this was sufficient for the operations. LCM pill A 350 kg/m3 LCM pill was ready and prepared in surface pits in case of loss situation. No losses seen and pill not used. Contamination The mud showed no signs of contamination while drilling the 1/2 section. Mud in tank 16 on Deepsea Nordkapp was contaminated once taken up to surface. The 100 m3 OBM was left-over from PGNiG and had a initial weight of sg and high OWR. No transfers were made in and out of this tank afterwards, so the rig suspected leak. The total volume in the 16 tank was 260 m3 when taking it out of the tank. The oil water ratio had dropped to 40/60 and the weight had dropped to sg. Odfjell and OKEA were advised about this situation and the OBM was sent to land as slops. This OBM was planned to be used for potential disconnect (displace the hole to heavier fluid). Due to the contamination, active mud had to be weighed up instead, also leading to less OBM volume then planned. Treatments Mud properties stayed well within spec throughout the drilling. The INNOVERT NS YELLOW OBM performed as expected. OWR stayed steady throughout drilling and so did the Fluid loss. Maintained rheology profile in spec by bleeding in BARAVIS 568 at 0.5kg/m3 increments (prior BDF-919 treatments at 7kg/m3 during section mud prep where deemed sufficient). Added BARAMUL at 8kg/m3 for enhanced emulsion (increased electrical stability reading). Added BARACARB50 (0.25kg/m3/hr - sx/hr ) for tighter fluid loss control (by aiding good quality thin filter cake ) to reduce chances of becoming differentially stuck at higher MW during coring/logging operations - as per OKEA request. The BARACARB50 treatment increased to 1kg/m3/hr - 8sx/hr at TD and continue during coring/drilling/logging. Observed HPHT FL reduction from 1.8ml to 1.6ml/30min. SOURSCAV and Baracide W-960 was used to treat slop sent to town. Added BARAMUL for emulsion, CaCl2 for salinity and barite to adjust weight of circulating system. Losses  No downhole losses were encountered during the section  Tank 16P > 100m3 of 1.45sg Innovert (OWR > 75/25) riser disconnect fluid was contaminated with 160m3 of water to give 260m3 1.21sg slops (OWR > 40/60) due to faulty pit sensor and leakage Wellbore Stability Good well bore stability was experienced throughout this short section.

All Rights Reserved Page 66 of 1626.1.2.1 SDL Experience Summary Drilling with high ROP When drilling with high ROP and returns as with this project, extra personnel are required. We had two Logging Geologist trainees out, however we have to plan for full double crew in advance. Also, if there are issues with technical equipment - like the gas system - that requires troubleshooting, it is very hard for the Data Engineer to focus as the stress level is very high. With 10 minutes per stand and minutes on connections, it is very difficult to work in good, safe manner. Consider having 3rd Data Engineer or technically competent person available during these sections. Live streaming data on web Background During Infill  and Skumnisse OKEA wanted to stream the drilling data on their public website. Since there was no established way of doing this, third party company (Cegal) set up Twitch streaming service on one of their machines, and displayed an InSite Anywhere template through an embedded web player. Execution Although it worked fine technically, we experienced quite few issues due to poor network quality on the rig. See the section further down for more details. The chain of data transfers and access levels was complex, and troubleshooting was hard as many people were involved at several different stages. It would also be good to set up way to communicate to the audience on what the activity on the rig is  during the original planning, this would be trivial task to accomplish as we were going to show time based log, and we could easily implement separate set of remarks for this stream only. However, the time based log was pulled in the last minute, and we could only display the Time/Depth Activity. This activity is for database purposes and describes the mode the InSite software is in on the rig, and is not descriptive of the operation as such. If we are to provide this as service in the future, we would recommend one of the two scenarios below: 1) Have an ADT/AFO service in the customer's office to follow up displays and maintain the Twitch stream, using the full version of InSite 2) Set up an extra PC offshore and have the Data Engineer maintain the Twitch stream, using the full version of InSite Both scenarios have their benefits and drawbacks. The ADT/AFO service would cover several other customer needs - do simulations and follow up on Surge / Swab, Torque / Drag, vibration, provide additional reports and data by demand. Having full database available in the customer's office is also major benefit. To do the streaming from the rig and have the Data Engineer maintain it will put more work on the already busy Data Engineer (see the point about high ROP above). Streaming data would put more strain on the network, although for data transmission purposes this might be more reliable solution as video stream is not affected by high latency the same way as the DataExchange is. Opportunities Live streaming drilling data to the public has to our knowledge never been done before. Other operators are very reluctant to share data at all, so all existing frameworks for displaying or otherwise accessing data in real time are highly protected. It is safe to say that we learned lot along the way. The original plan was to stream all data, but as we about to start the partners in the project objected, and several last minute changes were made to the data template. For the future, some sort of time based data would be good to implement as well. Using Twitch, gamers platform / community designed to share computer gameplay in real time, was good way to solve the challenge. But it also opened up the operation to different audience than usual. The Twitch stream itself had comments disabled, but it took some tweaking to get it right. CONFIDENTIAL  2019 Halliburton. All Rights Reserved Page 67 of 162As way to promote the company and the operation further, it could be an idea to do an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session in an online community. One could announce beforehand what and when something is going to happen, and open forum for Q&A as it happens  like I am drilling engineer / geologist / geophysicist, we are drilling into the reservoir live tonight. Ask me anything. Network issues We experienced frequent networking issues that affected our quality of service. The issues were mainly related to two things: 1) Poor network when connected through VSAT 2) Service failure when switching between VSAT and 4G/LTE networks When we were connected through VSAT, despite getting assigned the required bandwidth, our DataExchange (DEX) would frequently drop out and queue up. Since our database needs to confirm that the data is both sent and received correctly, there is lot of handshaking back and forth. When connected via VSAT, we observed very high latency on the network, ms when the normal should be 50 - 60ms. This high latency caused data transmission to behave erratic, although the bandwidth was sufficient for doing remote support using VNC. We also lost the Halliburton assigned network completely every time we changed over from VSAT to the much better suited 4G/LTE network and vice versa. This was due to routing issues with the Internet Service Provider (ISP) ITC. Despite very good follow up and support from both OKEA (Cegal) and Odfjell network administrators, this happened multiple times. To attempt to combat the network issues, we made several adjustments to optimize the DataExchange, like limiting unnecessary datasets and sending Active Run only. We also considered sending RealTime Data only, but were reluctant as it could potentially result in gaps in the logs as we approached the core point.  2019 Halliburton. All Rights Reserved Page 68 of 1626.1.3 DD Run Summary 36 section, Run 100: The BHA was run in and survey taken 10m above the seabed to confirm MWD operation. The seabed was tagged at 276.4m with 500lpm and no rotation. It was not possible to progress without rotation and WOB. An RPM of 30 and 1-2t WOB were used initially producing 0.5m/hr. The parameters were gradually increased to 4500lpm, 80rpm and WOB of 7t to achieve an acceptable ROP of 2m/hr. Moderate to severe surface vibration was experienced requiring the WOB to be reduced to mitigate. Bentonite HiVis sweeps of 15m3 were pumped twice per stand or when taking survey. Tough drilling continued with the occasional smoother interval. Two surveys were taken at 279m and 288m which showed inclinations of 0.71 and 0.60. Confirmation of verticality allowed for an increase to 10t WOB to optimise ROP. Below 310m the ROP gradually increased to 20  22m/ hr with 10t WOB and this continued to section TD at 331m. The TD survey also showed inclination of 0.13. The hole was swept clean and displaced to 1.3sg KCL mud prior to pooh. At surface the BHA was laid out in one 18m piece for use on the next well. 12 1/4 section, Run 200: The BHA was run in and TOC cement tagged at 328.8m. The MWD was function tested and downlink sent. The shoe track was drilled out with 3500lpm, 3t WOB and 40rpm. The shoe drilled in 30minutes and was reamed over twice. Drilling of new hole commenced with 3500lpm and controlling ROP to maximum of 100m/ hr until the BHA was clear of the conductor shoe and the shallow gas zone was drilled at 425m. The parameters where then staged up to 4500lpm, 100rpm, WOB 5-16t resulting in ROP of 150-180m/hr. The hole remained vertical with inclination below 0.5deg. The section was drilled to TD at 1056m. No vibration was seen during the run. After circulating the well clean with 10m3 hi-vis pills the well was displaced with 1.30sg KCL mud. Several tight spots were encountered on the way out requiring the area to be worked. When the ROV looked at the wellhead large accumulation of cuttings was seen and some time was spent washing the area with the bit. 8 1/2 section, Run 300: The BHA was run in and TOC tagged at 1018m. Started drilling the plug with 1700 lpm, 70 rpm and 3-4t WOB. Drilled out the cement and shoe track with 7t WOB, 70 rpm and 1600 lpm. The shoe track was drilled out with 1700pm, 3-5t WOB and 70rpm while displacing the well to 1.32sg OBM. Drilled 3m new formation and performed FIT to 1.63sg EMW. Commenced drilling 1/2 hole with 2000lpm, 120rpm, 4-7t wob and 110m/ hr. Once the BHA was clear of the casing shoe the parameters were staged up to 2200lpm, 160rpm, 4-15t wob, 250m/hr. At first the ECD increased to sg after increasing the RPMs to 160, possibly due to the mud not being sheared properly yet. Brought the RPMs down to 150 for few stands until the mud had been sheared and then increased to 160 again. After drilling two stands the inclination started to build to degree and held around degree. The ROP was maintained at 250 m/hr throughout the run until 1476m when the MWD was showing severe vibration (11g on the laterals). Reduced the WOB to counteract vibration and therefore sacrificed some of the ROP. The increase in ECD in the Tare formation was observed as expected, exceeding the recommendation of 1.57sg EMW to 1.59sg EMW. No action was taken as per instruction of OKEA drilling supervisor. As per program the ROP was reduced to 60m/hr from 1553m and the X-BAT enabled by downlinking. At 1564m there was problem with the travelling block and needed troubleshooting. String was in slips for hrs without circulation. At 19:05, connected circulating head and circulated well clean with no rotation. The mud weight was raised to 1.41sg (riser margin) and after some repairs the BHA was pulled into the shoe where further repairs were carried out. Once the repairs were certified by Lloyds the BHA was RIH again and drilling resumed. Because of the higher mud weight of 1.41sg the flow was limited to 2000lpm due to the maximum ECD of 1.57sg EMW. The ROP was reduced to 30 m/hr from the start instead of waiting for top Spekk due to the ECD limitation as well. Core point was called at 1669m, the hole was circulated clean with 2000lpm and 160rpm before pulling out 8 1/2 section, Run 500: M/U BHA 500 (post-core FEWD assy to TD). Initially experienced some comms issues between MWD computer and tools, but was eventually resolved. Erected barriers, secured RF, loaded radioactive sources, and RIH to logging depth, 1612m. Logged 1612-1687m & D/A @ 30 m/hr controlled for log quality. TD was called at 1775m by WSG, and reached without issue. Survey @ TD.  2019 Halliburton.

BHA Run Summary The BHA was run in and survey taken 10m above the seabed to confirm MWD operation. The seabed was tagged at 276.4m with 500lpm and no rotation. It was not possible to progress without rotation and WOB. An RPM of 30 and 1-2t WOB were used initially producing 0.5m/hr. The parameters were gradually increased to 4500lpm, 80rpm and WOB of 7t to achieve an acceptable ROP of 2m/hr. Moderate to severe surface vibration was experienced requiring the WOB to be reduced to mitigate. Bentonite HiVis sweeps of 15m3 were pumped twice per stand or when taking survey. Tough drilling continued with the occasional smoother interval. Two surveys were taken at 279m and 288m which showed inclinations of 0.71 and 0.60. Confirmation of verticality allowed for an increase to 10t WOB to optimise ROP. Below 310m the ROP gradually increased to 20  22m/hr with 10t WOB and this continued to section TD at 331m. The TD survey also showed inclination of 0.13. The hole was swept clean and displaced to 1.3sg KCL mud prior to pooh. At surface the BHA was laid out in one 18m piece for use on the next well. The bit graded 2-1-WT-A-E-I-NO-TD. It was seen that the spear section at the end of one cone was completely worn. Drilling hours 15.2hrs Circulating hours 17.8hrs Distance drilled 54.6m Average ROP 3.59m/hr Krevs 61. BHA Recommendations Drilled 36 section. Directional only used for inclination values. No significant vibration observed during drilling. Max flow observed - 4500 lpm, which did not exceed operational limits.  2019 Halliburton.

The BHA was run in and TOC cement tagged at 328.8m. The MWD was function tested and downlink sent. The shoe track was drilled out with 3500lpm, 3t WOB and 40rpm. The shoe drilled in 30minutes and was reamed over twice. Drilling of new hole commenced with 3500lpm and controlling ROP to maximum of 100m/hr until the BHA was clear of the conductor shoe and the shallow gas zone was drilled at 425m. The parameters where then staged up to 4500lpm, 100rpm, WOB 5-16t resulting in ROP of 150-180m/hr. The hole remained vertical with inclination below 0.5deg. The section was drilled to TD at 1056m. No vibration was seen during the run. After circulating the well clean with 10m3 hi-vis pills the well was displaced with 1.30sg KCL mud. Several tight spots were encountered on the way out requiring the area to be worked. When the ROV looked at the wellhead large accumulation of cuttings was seen and some time was spent washing the area with the bit. At the surface no wear was seen on the motor and the bit was graded 1-1-WT-A-E-I-NO-TD.

Started drilling the plug with 1700 lpm, 70 rpm and 3-4T WOB. Drilled out the cement and shoe track with 7T WOB, 70 rpm and 1600 lpm. The shoe track was drilled out with 1700pm, 3-5t WOB and 70rpm while displacing the well to 1.32sg OBM. Drilled 3m new formation and performed FIT to 1.63sg EMW. Commenced drilling 8-1/2 hole with 2000lpm, 120rpm, 4-7T wob and 110m/hr. Once the BHA was clear of the casing shoe the parameters were staged up to 2200lpm, 160rpm, 4-15T wob, 250m/HR. At first the ECD increased to sg after increasing the RPMs to 160, possibly due to the mud not being sheared properly yet. Brought the RPMs down to 150 for few stands until the mud had been sheared and then increased to 160 again. After drilling two stands the inclination started to build to degree and held around degree.The ROP was maintained at 250 m/hr throughout the run until 1476m when the MWD was showing severe vibration (11g on the laterals). Reduced the WOB to counteract vibration and therefore sacrificed some of the ROP. The increase in ECD in the Tare formation was observed as expected, exceeding the recommendation of 1.57sg EMW to 1.59sg EMW. No action was taken as per instruction of OKEA drilling supervisor. As per program the ROP was reduced to 60m/hr from 1553m and the X-BAT enabled by downlinking. At 1564m there was problem with the traveling block and needed troubleshooting. String was in slips for hrs without circulation. At 19:05, connected circulating head and circulated well clean with no rotation. The mud weight was raised to 1.41sg (riser margin) and after some repairs the BHA was pulled into the shoe where further repairs were carried out. Once the repairs were certified by Lloyds the BHA was RIH again and drilling resumed. Because of the higher mud weight of 1.41sg the flow was limited to 2000lpm due to the maximum ECD of 1.57sg EMW. The ROP was reduced to 30 m/hr from the start instead of waiting for top Spekk due to the ECD limitation as well. Core point was called at 1669m. At core point the hole was circulated clean with 2000lpm and 160rpm before pulling out. Bit Grading Out: 6-4-LT-N-X-2-BT-CP. It was determined that the FEWD string could be re-run to TD the well after the coring run. BHA performed to spec. No problem to hold the inclination close to vertical. Sperry drilling provided XBAT, ADR, DGR, PWD, SDC and directional tools with rotary assembly.ALD and CTN in the string without sources, to save rig time on bha handling. RIH and tagged cement.

All Rights Reserved Page 123 of 162ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Analyses of the cuttings were conducted at the well site using binocular microscope and an ultraviolet light source. The interpreted lithology is based on cuttings and drilling parameters such as rate of penetration weight on bit, torque, background gas values and MWD (gamma and resistivity log). Lithological boundaries were interpolated between two neighbouring cutting samples if no significant change in drilling parameters occurred. The gas was monitored by means of Total Hydrocarbon Gas detector (Flame Ionisation Detector - FID), calibrated such that 50 API units are equal to % total gas in the air. Gas Chromatograph was used for detailed breakdown of the gas into its different components and was calibrated to analyse C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4 and C5. Gas Chromatograph values are reported in parts per million (ppm). Below is brief explanation of the use of different gas ratios in the enclosed Gas Ratio Plot. C1 ratios (C1/ C2, C1 / C3, and C1/ C4) display the amount of each component compared to the amount of C1. The ratios will decrease with depth as more mature sediments are encountered. Mature source rocks and hydrocarbon reservoirs show low ratios. Productive dry gas zones may only show C1, but very high shows of C1 are usually indicative of salt water. If the C1/ C2 ratio is low in the oil section and the C1/ C4 ratio is high in the gas section, the zone is probably non-productive. If C1/ C4 is less than C1/ C3, the zone is probably water bearing. As rule of thumb the following ratio values can be used to evaluate the C1 Ratios (these ratios may not be definitive for low permeability zones): Table Gas Ratios RESIDUAL / NON-PRODUCTIVE OIL GAS Light to Heavy Ratio (LHR): C1 + C2 / C3 + C4 + C5 100. The LHR is expected to decrease with depth. It is also good coal indicator (as coal gas is very high in C1 and C2). If the LHR ratio falls below then they are probably non-productive gases and if the LHR is equal to or greater than 100 they are probably light and non-productive gases. Gas Wetness Ratio (GWR): (= C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 / C1) gives an indication of maturity. It will increase with depth, as the C1 fraction will represent smaller part of the total light HC. However, if the GWR ratio is higher than 48 there is probability of heavy or dead oil. Oil Character Qualifier (OCQ): C4 + C5 / C3. Under some circumstances, high amounts of C1 will mask the presence of oil. This may be in water wet zones or in gas cap reservoir. GWR and LHR could then be misinterpreted. However, in the presence of oil, C4 + C5 will increase relative to C3 and therefore the OCQ.  2019 Halliburton.
