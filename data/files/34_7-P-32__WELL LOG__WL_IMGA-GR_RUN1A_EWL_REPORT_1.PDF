SUMMARY Snorre General An Ultrasonic Imaging Tool (USIT) was run in the Snorre well, 34/7-P32 on the 14th of November 2004. This well was previously logged in 2002 with multifinger caliper and USIT. The well is known to have collapsed casing sections at 362m  368m, 522m  532m and 1019m  1023m. These sections were forced open with hardware prior to logging with the USIT. Statoil want to inspect the integrity of the casing and obtain burst pressure rating below the lowest damaged zone. If the casing is found to be in good condition, this casing will be used as donor for sidetrack and re-drill. Statoil also need to have an understanding of the cement quality and the top of cement as the damaged section of pipe is to be cut and pulled and re-completed in the future. The original drilling fluid was oil base mud which was present in the annulus in 1995. Statoil suspect that the barite has since settled out of the drilling mud. Pipe Integrity Interpretation Drill pipe wear is in evidence through much of the logged interval. Otherwise, the internal casing below 1025m is generally in very good condition. The minimum remaining wall thickness is inches, which translates to burst pressure rating of 5376psi using the accuracy of thickness from USIT. Cement Integrity Interpretation The top of cement is seen at 1564m. Cement interpretation has been complicated as the borehole fluid is not homogeneous. The effects of barite settling out of the original drilling oil base mud is seen from 1564.5m  1150m. Interpretation above 1150m is less clear. The casing should be free above 1150m if Statoil are sure that there is no cement here. DCS, Aberdeen Page May 20042. USI LOG QUALITY CONTROL To derive an accurate measurement of internal radius (and cement quality), the acoustic properties of the borehole fluid must be known. The USI tool measures these properties i.e. the acoustic impedance and velocity. Normally this is done on continuous basis while running in the hole in Fluid Properties Measurement mode (FPM). At the time of logging the casing was filled with 11.6lb/gal brine. Expected acoustic impedance and fluid slowness of this brine can be estimated using sonic calculator and are respectively equal to MRayl and s/ft. There was good agreement between the theoretical and the measured acoustic impedance (see Figure 1) and slowness of the borehole fluid (see Figure 2) between 2800m and 1650m indicating that the borehole fluid over this interval is brine. However, the values for the fluid acoustic impedance and slowness above 1650m to surface indicate that the fluid is not homogeneous. Furthermore, three spikes are seen on the acoustic impedance plot with tally with the three zones of casing damage. It is possible that traces of the oil based mud that was in the annulus between the 13-3/8 inch casing and the 9-5/8 inch casing has entered the well through the damaged 9-5/8 inch casing. As we do not have homogeneous fluid above 1650m, interpretation of the cement above this depth is complicated as the acoustic impedance of the fluid is unknown. The data was acquired with the following sampling rates: Main Log 2830  360M Normal Resolution: 10 deg (36 radial samples per vertical level), inch vertical Repeat Section - High Resolution: deg (72 radial samples per vertical level), inch vertical The maximum eccentralistaion allowed for 9-5/8 inch pipe is inches (less than 2% of the casing diameter). The eccentralisation curve (ECCE) reads below these values through most of the log, which indicates that the tool is effectively centralized and that the data recorded is of good quality. In order to obtain the best possible log, scraper was run prior to the USIT in order to remove any inner wall deposits, which may affect the tool response.3. INTERPRETATION DISCUSSION PIPE INTEGRITY There is evidence of an inner wall eroded groove that is fairly continuous throughout the logged interval. The groove appears to be on the low side from 2830m to 1425m, above which point the groove alternates between high side and low side (see Figure 3). This groove is probably drill pipe/hardwear induced. When present, the condition can be observed as continuous red stripe through the acoustic radius image (track 3). In view of the fact that the pipe wear has occurred in- situ, the effect can be seen to be continuous throughout collars. The eroded feature is also discernible on the very sensitive first echo amplitude, where it can be observed as dark stripe. These areas of lower amplitude represent the shoulders of the groove where the first echo is reduced due to the poor angle of incidence between the transducer face and the pipe wall. It is also likely that there are deposits on the inner wall surface, which further reduce the first echo amplitude at these levels. The minimum wall thickness seen on the log is not surprisingly over an interval affected by the eroded groove. The minimum thickness drops to inches at 1512.5m (see Figure 4). Assuming L80 grade (80,000psi), this translates to burst pressure rating of 5376psi (see equation in Appendix E). It should be noted that no safety factor has been applied, but the burst pressure has been derated for specific tool accuracy of 2%. CEMENT INTEGRITY 2828m  2540m Patchy cement with channel of contaminated cement on the low side. 2540m  2310m Fully bonded cement with an impedance of  6Mrayl. 2310m  2146m Acoustic impedance lowers to around 4MRayl. Patchy cement present. Pattern of cement is markedly different from the interval above. This most likely indicates lithological effect. 2146m  1940m Acoustic impedance increases again above 5MRayl. Generally well bonded cement in this interval. 1940m  1907m Acoustic impedance drops again to as low as 2MRayl. This coincides with the low gamma ray. 1907  1564.5m Acoustic impedance increases to 5-6 MRayl. Generally fully bonded cement over this interval. channel of contaminated cement is present from 1602m  1585m. The top of cement is seen at 1564.5m.As discussed in the log quality control section, the cement evaluation above 1650m is complicated as the borehole fluid is not homogeneous. 1564.5m  1150m The acoustic image is very smooth. The acoustic impedance is low at 3Mrayl and gradually decreases. This is consistent with settled barite from oil base mud as is the higher impedance material when found on the low side of the pipe. Third interface reflections are seen at 1350m and 1325m which indicate that the 9-5/8 inch casing is either touching or very close to the 13-3/8 inch casing at these depths. 1150  360m The increase in spikes and the high variability patterned image appears to be related to casing shape. The debond logic indicates that this is debonded cement however, this is inconsistent with the fluid indication below and the theoretical top of cement. The casing here should be free however, it would be wise to check the volume of cement pumped with this.Figures4.

APPENDIX B: USI tool specifications Description of the tool The UltraSonic Imager (USIT) is wireline tool designed for cement evaluation and casing corrosion/wear detection using ultrasonic pulses. rotating transducer emits short ultrasonic pulse which excites thickness-mode resonance in the casing. Analysis of the echo gives four measurements: internal radius, inner wall rugosity, casing thickness and (where applicable) cement acoustic impedance. Depending upon the objective of the survey either degree or 10 degree radial sampling can be employed ( i.e. 36 or 72 samples per level). To derive an accurate measurement of internal radius and cement quality, the acoustic properties of the borehole fluid must be known. The USI tool measures these properties (i.e. the acoustic impedance and velocity) on continuous basis while running in the hole in Fluid Properties Measurement mode (FPM).

However, in view of the fact that the USI dataset provides an absolute figure for remaining wall thickness, it is possible to discount the safety factor from the equation resulting in more accurate pressure rating.
