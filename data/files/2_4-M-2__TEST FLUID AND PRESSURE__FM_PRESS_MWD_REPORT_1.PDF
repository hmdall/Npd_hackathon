GeoTap Pressure Analysis Report Well : 2/4-M-02 Customer : ConocoPhillips Processed by : MB Jacobsen Date : 24-Jul-2006Summary Geotap pressure tests were taken in run 510. All tests were single drawdown tests with cc/sec drawdown rate and 10 cc chamber size. The tests were taken in Pumps On mode. All tests are presented with high resolution data, samples/record (5 Hz). Two of the tests were aborted from surface, tests # and 9, so 16 tests were acctually taken, but the test numbering will show 18 tests. Three of the tests, tests # 2, 10 & 12, had no seal. These tests were repeated by moving the tool approximately foot down, except for test # 12, and good seal was obtained. Test # 12 was taken in large washout zone, so the tool was moved down to approx. 13,125 ft MD (test # 13) and a good test was taken. Test # seems to be supercharged, but is still good test. Rest of the tests were good tests. Summary of the tests taken: Total tests: 18 Good tests: 13 No Seal: Aborted tests: DATA, RECOMMENDATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS LIMITATIONS Because of the uncertainty of variable well conditions the necessity of relying on facts and supporting services furnished by others, Halliburton IS UNABLE TO GUARANTEE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS, NOR THE RESULTS OF ANY TREATMENT OR SERVICE, NOR THE ACCURACY OF ANY CHART INTERPRETATION, RESEARCH ANALYSIS, JOB RECOMMENDATION OR OTHER DATA FURNISHED by Halliburton.
