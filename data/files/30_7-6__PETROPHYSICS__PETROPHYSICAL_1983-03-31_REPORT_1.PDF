The results of the analysis show good agreement with core measurements, indicating that the correct methodology was used. The report begins by describing the reservoir geology. This is followed by review of the original data and description of the log analysis methods used. While results are summarised in this report, level-by-level log analysis results, together with crossplots are bound separately as an Appendix. Results are also shown separately on graphical display.30/7-8 Tarbert (4 BRT) The section is composed of five major sand units which are separated by thin coals and/or shales. The core description would appear to indicate that the sediments were deposited in delta plain environment, dominated by fluvial process. This is suggested by the variable grain sizes, presence of conglomerates, coals and rootlet horizons and the sedimentary structures. The contrast in reservoir properties between the five units is marked and, as is discussed later this appears to be function of the presence of mica. However, it is noticeable from the brief notes in the core description that the zones with low permeabilities are dominantly composed of very fine to fine grained sandstones while those with high permeabilities are formed by coarse grained sandstones. This tendancy for mica to be associated with fine grained intervals is to be expected from the minerals hydrodynamic characteristics and has been noted in other Brent Sand fields. In 30/7-8 it seems likely that the combination of very fine sandstones and mica has caused the high water saturations found in the micaceous units. The low permeabilities would also be result of this combination of small pores and pore throats and platy minerals. The Tarbert reservoir in this well would be expected to act in layered fashion with this effect being reinforced by the shale/coal barriers between sands as well as the two low permeability micaceous sand units. It has been found that permeability contrast is an important factor to be considered in development of gas condensate reservoir especially where gas cycling is an option. This problem was the subject of theoretical study by INTERCOMP staff in London, some of the results of which were reported in paper (EUR 280) at the 1982 European Petroleum Conference. copy of the paper is included in the Reference. 30/7-6 Tarbert (3 BRT) The same five reservoir units can be traced between this well and 30/7-8, but as is discussed later, the sands in 30/7-6 have higher porosity and markedly lowermica content. By analogy with the 30/7-8 core description it seens likely that the lower content of mica indicates that the sands are coarser grained and so have lower water saturation and higher permeability. Thus, (where there is no core available), consideration might be given to using the mica content and water saturation values obtained by log analysis as qualitative indicators of permeability. Clearly the depositional environment was probably of higher energy in the 30/7-6 area than in 30/7-8. The result of this on reservoir quality makes good reservoir geological model important, especially in system as sensitive to permeability contrasts as gas condensate reservoir. It is noteworthy that other reservoirs in the Tarbert Formation in this area show similar variability. The Ness Member in both wells is dominantly shale with minor sand units. Further to the north, the Ness was deposited in lagoonal/delta plain complex of environments, and this could also be the case in these wells, but the well logs alone are not sufficient for determination of this kind. It seems likely that the sands present would only be poorly connected.The following logs are available for study: 30/7-6 ISF/BHC/GR/SP DLL/MSFL/GR/SP FDC/CNL/GR 30/7-8 (II) ISF/SLS/GR/SP LDT/CNL/GR N GT In both wells the log coverage is adequate to provide reliable interpretation. Calibration for most of the logs fall within the normally acceptable tolerances. For the CNL on well 30/7-8, the calibration seems to have drifted slightly and the difference between the before and after calibrations on the ratio curve is 0.056, where tolerance of is the normally accepted limit. This is equivalent to drift of 0.8% limestone porosity. For the NGT on this well no comment can be made on the calibration without seeing the log print, but from the crossplots it would appear that the thorium curve reads about ppm too low. (This may be due to some as yet unpublished environmental corrections.) The heavy barite mud renders the Pe curve on the LDT unreadable. Hole conditions in both wells were poor, leading to tool sticking. In 30/7-8 the hole is over gauge through most of the section. By splicing and patching the various repeat runs, reasonable input log suite was generated for 30/7-8,although the MSFL loses pad contact in places. For 30/7-6, the FDC/CNL sticking problems were very severe, and for two short sections in the Ness, the log could not be used, and the sonic log was used instead. In addition, to the logs, core data and geological reports were provided, proving particularly useful in these complex wells.An overview of the processes involved is shown in Figure 1. The log tapes were read, decoded and loaded into the computer. Core data was entered by hand and merged with the raw log data. Zones where the logging tool was obviously sticking were replaced, where possible, by repeat sections. As mentioned previously, over some sections nothing could be done. Plots were made of the data on composite log in order to verify the computer file against the source logs. (There was in fact discrepancy on the deep laterolog for well 30/7-6 between 4013 and 4029m where the deep laterolog appears to fail. Close examination of the log print reveals splice in the film over this section, but we were unable to locate this repeat on the tape. For the analysis the induction log was used over this section.) For interest, the synthetic microlog response, derived from the MSFL, was played back for well 30/7-8, although this was not available on the print. For clarity of presentation, the NGT was played back separately, including the various ratios of the component curves. Environmental corrections were applied in accordance with the chart book, and the core data were depth matched to the logs. Crossplots of the matched and corrected data were produced to aid parameter selection, and these are shown in the Appendix. The crossplots include some derived values such as and values and: - apparent porosity, being (OCNL + OD)/2, uncorrected for clay or hydrocarbon effects; - apparent matrix density from the neutron density crossplot, again with uncorrected values; - apparent water resistivity, OA Rt;apparent volumetric photelectric absorption index Pe Umaa - 1 - OA but this was not really useable due to the heavy barite mud. From study of the raw log data and crossplots, it is clear that the interpretation problem is far from straightforward. Mica is present in both wells, but with much higher proportion in 30/7-8. Mica is heavy and radioactive and can easily be misinterpreted as being shale. This would lead to pessimistic evaluation of hydrocarbon-in-place. For well 30/7-8, NGT log is available. This is particularly useful where mica is present as the tool allows the distinction between mica (with high proportion of potassium-parented gamma rays) and clay (with higher proportion of thorium- parented gamma rays). If the thorium-potassium ratio is between and 3.5, this is most likely due to mica, whereas most clays have ratio above This effect is illustrated in figures and 3, showing thorium-potassium crossplots for the Tarbert and the Ness. The mica trend can clearly be seen in the Tarbert, but some clay is still present, whereas the Ness contains little or no mica. Comparison of the thorium-potassium ratio curve with the core descriptions shows good correlation between low ratio and presence of mica. There is also good correlation in this well between the presence of mica and the caliper showing oven gauge hole. This is consistent with the physical properties of mica, whose fine plate-like structure both blocks permeability and the formation of mudcake, and encourages the formation to flake away under abrasion. The presence of mica is, therefore, well established and the problem is selection of an interpretation method which is applicable to both wells. Any method which relies heavily on the NGT for example could not be used for 30/7-6. The standard approach would be to estimate the mica content from the vs GR plot and to use dual mineral method (for quartz and mica) for porosity.

The method adopted was to use INTERCOMP's ROCKS program to determine the mica content. The program uses the neutron, density and sonic logs to calculate the volumes of sand, shale, mica and porosity by least squares best fit technique. (In effect, the program solves four simultaneous equations - being the three log response equations plus the assumption that the four components add up to unity. Where an exact solution is not found, the solution giving the minimum error is used.) This method does not allow for hydrocarbon effects and assigns equal weight to each of the input logs and, therefore, is not considered precise enough to use the derived porosity values directly. (An error of, say, 10% on porosity value is clearly unacceptable, but an error of 10% on the mica fraction introduces an error of only pu on porosity.) The mica fraction, therefore, was calculated using the three porosity logs. This figure was then used to correct the response of the neutron and density logs to obtain the response for an equivalent mica-free formation. p brne = - Vmica mica ON = ON - Vmica ONmica mc These corrected responses were then entered into the neutron density crossplot, and porosity was calculated after correcting for shale and hydrocarbon effects as in the usual complex lithology method. This porosity is, of course, the porosity of the mica-free portion of the formation, and is, multiplied by (1 - Vmica) to get the corrected effective porosity. Shale Volume, Vsh, was taken from the minimum shale volume as indicated by the gamma ray, neutron, resistivity, neutron-density and density-sonic crossplots. In zones of bad hole, the program disallows the crossplot indicators. For well 30/7-8, the thorium curve of the NGT was used as the gamma ray. INTERCOMPFormation Factor, F, was taken as a = Om with = and = as determined from special core analysis in well 30/4-2. Formation Water Resistivity, Rw, was taken from the data supplied, based on samples from 29/6-1. Log Rw = Log (T) + (There appears to be some typing/arithmetic error in the alternative relationship provided. Our calculations indicate an Arps constant of 8.68.) Water Saturation, Sw, was taken from the Indonesia equation, with value of the saturation exponent, 'n', being as supplied by special core analysis. In the invaded zone Sxo was calculated as usual with the Indonesia equation, but replacing Rt with Rxo and Rw with Rmf. In well 30/7-8 where the MSFL pad loses contact with the borehole, Sxo was taken as Sw.3. Hydrocarbon Density, h, was taken as gm/cc, as shown by the RFT pressure gradient. Other constants used in the analysis were selected from crossplots and are shown in the Appendix at the beginning of each zone. Permeability was calculated from the relationship: Logio (KLog) Log - Vmica This relationship reflects the basic k/O relationship with the first term, and the second term accounts for the reduction in permeability due to the presence of mica. As may be seen in the Appendix, for the same value of porosity, sandwith 30% mica has approximately 1/100th of the permeability of mica-free sand. This relationship agreed well with the core measured values, so may be seen on the results display. For well 30/7-6, the above transform gives unrealistic values for permeability. Since no core data were available for this well, any transform is somewhat arbitrary, but the following transform gives plausible results, and may be used as a qualitative index to compare one section with another in the well. Logio (KLog) =I 5.0 RESULTS The computed results are shown on level-by-level log basis in the Appendix, followed by the post-interpretation crossplots. The results are discussed below. With 11% cut-off on porosity ( = mD) and 70% cut-off in water saturation, this zone shows net pay with average porosity of 16.76% and average water saturation of 36.92%. The net sand interval (5% cut-off on porosity, no Sw cut-off) is with an average of 16.21% porosity. The interval is made up of alternating clean and micaceous sandstones, separated by thin shales or coals. The clean sands show high porosities, low water saturation and excellent permeability. The micaceous sands show slightly lower porosities, but with much higher water saturations and drastically reduced permeabilities. This is consistent with the relatively high surface area of mica flakes holding higher proportion of bound water, and also reducing the permeability. So although the water saturations are higher (40-50%) in the micaceous sands (4079-97 and 4107-27 mBRT), this is almost certainly irreducible water saturation and these sands should be included in any estimation of hydrocarbon-in-place. A gas-water contact is seen at mBRT. At the base of the Tarbert, below 4147 m, the water saturation appears to decrease. This is quite genuine reflection of the log data as may be seen by inspection. All the resistivity tools show an increase towards the base of this sand. This may represent tar mat, possibly coinciding with relict gas water contact. This well shows even better reservoir development than 30/7-8. With 11% cut- off on porosity and 70% on water saturation, the zone shows net pay with an average porosity of 21.2% and water saturation of 14.6%. With 5% porosity cut-off, the net sand interval becomes m, with average porosity of 20.58%.The mica content in this well is much lower than in 30/7-8 which is reflected on the improved porosity and water saturation figures. There is no evidence of gas-water contact in the Tarbert, but saturation increases in the Ness. The Ness offers much less attractive reservoir prospect than the Tarbert, being mainly shale with some fairly thin interbedded sands. As previously discussed, these sands appear to be mica-free. Using Rw from the Tarbert (which would appear to be correct giving Sw's around 100% below mBRT), fairly low water saturations are calculated throughout the Ness. Indeed, if the cut-offs of 11% porosity and 70% Sw are applied, the zone shows some net pay with average porosity 15.86% and Sw of 53.7%. If no cut-offs are applied on water saturation, the net sand becomes of 15.4% average porosity with 11% cut-off, and becomes 36.73 of average 9.7% if cut-off of 5% is used. Note that over much of this zone, the MSFL was not useable, and the reset value for Sxo = SIN'3 was used. Therefore, although the results display shows moveable hydrocarbon, this may not in fact be the case. Again, using the same Rw as for the Tarbert, water saturations are calculated which are fairly low. With 11% cut-off on porosity, this zone shows net sand with an average porosity of 17.4% and 56% Sw. With 5% cut-off on porosity, the net sand is increased to of 14.0% porosity average. For consistency of interpretation, the Ness was assumed, like 30/7-8, to be mica- free.30/7-6 Etive, Rannoch and Broom These sands are also apparently hydrocarbon-bearing. With 11% cut-off on porosity, the net sands are as follows: Etive 4028-4035 MBRT net % average porosity Rannoch 4035-4051 MBRT net % average porosity Broom 4051-4057 MBRT net % average porosity6.0 DISCUSSION The effect of accounting for mica correctly is to increase the hydrocarbon-in- place in the Tarbert in both wells, although the effect is more marked in 30/7-8. While the permeability in the micaceous sands is markedly reduced, these would probably still be capable of production, especially gas. The permeability contrast, however, may lead to completion/production and reservoir management problems. The Ness in both wells is somewhat puzzling as the interpretation shows some hydrocarbon saturation at moderate (ca 60%) but remarkably constant level. In the absence of any other information it would be tempting to conclude that the wrong value for Rw had been used, but there is no obvious change shown on the SP between the Ness and the Tarbert, and the Rw value is clearly correct at the base of the Tarbert in 30/7-8. It would seem, therefore, that the calculated values are in fact reflecting genuine hydrocarbon saturation, which is probably all residual. The use of and values derived from special core analysis on near by wells is sometimes considered controversial and so run was made on each well using more generally accepted values of = = 2.0. The difference on net hydrocarbon feet is fairly small, with the two factors tending to cancel one another, thus: 30/7-6 11% Porosity/70% Sw Cut-Off 5% Porosity Cut-Off Net Pay Porosity Sw Net Sand Porosity Tarbert 30/7-8 As may be seen, there is little sensitivity to these changes.The good agreement with core data, and the lack of sensitivity to the and n values, suggests that the results in the Tarbert in both wells may be used with confidence. In the Ness, poor borehole conditions have led to rather less reliable log readings, with corresponding reduction in the confidence that may be placed in the results. However, since the reservoir quality in the Ness is generally poor, this is probably not too significant. Development of the Tarbert will be far from straightforward with such marked permeability contrast within the reservoir. Some comments on this problem are presented in the Reference.EUR 280 THE USE OF INTEGRAILD SIMULATION STUDIES TO PREDICT FIELD PERFORMANCE BY A.F. CORRIGAN, RI. LOLLEY, D.D. HANDYSIDE AND INTERCOM' RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING (UK) D. WALDEN LIMIILU iEUROPEAN PETROLEUM :CONFERENCE Copyright kl.2 European Petroleum Conlerence This paper was presented at the European Petroleum Conterence heel in London England 25-28 October 1982 The rIldiblidl lb aubiu,t R, to,..tiur, by 1111, Prerrnasekin copy reSIOCISO 10 an MbsItaCI of not more than 300 words ABSTRACT The paper presents examples of the use of reservoir simulation techniques, such as cross-section analysis, to allow quantification of features of the reservoir geological model. By this method, numerically realistic values can be assigned to such phenomena as the areal extent of permeability barriers and the effective vertical permeability over number of sand/shale alternations. further important use of the technique is the evaluation of complex developments such as gas condensate reservoirs. This study indicates that the performance of these reservoirs will be very difficult to predict and will be heavily dependent on the geology of the reservoir. INTRODUCTION The development history of many North Sea fields has been marked by unpredictable production performance caused by geological factors which were not anticipated during development planning. Chief of these factors is the presence of thin, very highly permeable zones which caused problems such as early water breakthrough and forced the revision of production profiles. The profiles had been developed from reservoir models which assumed that the producing sands were homogeneous and it was only after some years of production, with most of the fields' wells already drilled, that the extent of the problem was realised. With the benefit of hindsight it is clear that if the presence of the high permeability zones had been recognised early in the appraisal stage, and the reservoir model amended accordingly, then changes to the production profile and development programme could have been made. The building of an effective reservoir model relies on close cooperation between the disciplines of geology, log analysis and reservoir engineering, and number of papers have been written on the use of this 'synergy' approach and its value. major practical problem, however, in the integrated approach is the difficulty experienced by geologists in matching their detailed reservoir description to the coarse layering of the reservoir simulation model, and the inability to define the reservoir model in terms of numerical parameters. further problem is reflected by the data sources used in reservoir modelling. The geologist and log analyst rely on data from within, or very close to, the wellbore and so the extension of their reservoir model from well to well depends, at least in part, on analogy with similar situations elsewhere. In contrast, the data collected by the reservoir engineer in terms of pressures, well tests etc. arguably reflect much wider area of investigation.In this paper, approaches are suggested to solving some of the above problems, and thereby improving reservoir simulation modelling, by extending the scope of integrated studies. The essence of the technique is use of simulation data to refine the reservoir geological model, which itself can then be used in an iterative manner to improve the simulation. Where production data is available, both cross-sectional and full field simulations may be used, but the former can be of particular value. Where the reservoir model is being constructed early in the life of the field and no production has occurred, slightly different approach is adopted which can provide the reservoir's sensitivity to various geological and development alternatives and indicate where critical data are not available. Two studies are used to illustrate the approach. In the first, black oil case where production data is available, the stages in the analysis are described, and examples of the use of cross-sectional and full field models in defining the reservoir model are discussed. The second study reflects the interest being shown in the gas condensate potential of the North Sea. In this case, simple but geologically realistic model is used to assess the best development programme for maximising fluid recovery from gas condensate field and to examine the sensitivity of the programme to changes in the reservoir geological model. FIELD WITH PRODUCTION DATA The field, which has been in production for several years, is developed in thick package of sandstones separated by thin shales. The minimum spacing between wells is kilometer and so the initial problem was correlation of sand units. The following is description of the steps taken in building the reservoir geological model of the field. 1. Correlation Figure illustrates typical relationship between wells. The problem immediately arises of correlation: are the sand bodies, which have different log responses, in fact the same? As important, is the question of the sealing capacity of the tight zones, which again appear different on logs. Up to twenty discrete sand units may occur within well, each separated by thin tight zone. The reservoir thins updip (figure 2) and the number of sand units decreases in this direction. Clearly, it was important when building the reservoir model to decide whether the tight zones between the sands are continuous and would act as permeability barriers, and to decide on correlation of the sand units updip as they decreased in number. By study of cores it was possible to demonstrate that the sands were deposited in fluviatile environment. More specifically, it appeared that deposition of the sands and shales occurred in braided stream environment. In this situation, river flow occurs in large number of channels which are constantly switching, eroding into one another and being refilled with sediment. The system is markedly unpredictable, as is the quality and composition of sands being deposited. However, by analogy with both ancient and recent braided stream deposits it was possible to hypothesize that neither the sands, nor the non-reservoir zones between them would be areally extensive. The tendency for new channels to be continually cut down into the shales and filled with sand reduces the effect of any shale zones and allows reasonable communication between the sand units (figure 3). Thus, core study enabled the initial assumption that the tight zones present would not form extensive permeability barriers. 2. Log Analysis of Sand Quality A lack of core in many wells forced extensive reliance on well log data. Although the individual sand units varied from ten to fifty feet in thickness, it was possible to make very important division of the reservoir on the basis of the composition of the INTERCOMP rntight zones between the sands. Throughout the reservoir, the lower sands were separated by true shales with the gamma ray log tracking both the porosity logs and the SP log. However, as can be seen in figure 4, in the upper part of the reservoir the same apparent relationship exists except that, in the zones between sands, the SP log does not track with the gamma ray and porosity logs. In fact, the tight zones are composed of fine sand and silt cemented by a carbonate cement which is anomalously radioactive, and contains only minor amounts of clay as indicated by the quiescent SP log. The change in property of the rock is also indicated by the matrix density which, as can be seen in figure 4, is markedly higher in the upper unit. The change in sand character was traced throughout the field and indicates marked change in depositional environment and, potentially, in reservoir behaviour. This discovery enabled the cross-sectional model to be refined (figure 5), giving much better control on the updip distribution of sand units. The upper sand unit clearly has eroded down into the lower unit. The different depositional environment of the upper unit, as reflected in generally thicker beds and less clay, also led to better sorting of the sands themselves (sorting being measure of the variation in grain size in sand). This is important because of the effect it has on the reservoir quality of the sandstone. Figure shows comparison of the porosity/permeability characteristics of the better sorted upper sand with the more poorly sorted lower sand. At high porosities the upper sand has much improved permeability, but at low porosities the lower sand is more permeable, presumably because the greater variety of grain sizes and more irregular packing allows better communication between pores. The relationship shown in figure shows the importance of using different cut offs once the two sand bodies had been defined. Obviously if the same cut off was used for both sand units an error would be made in defining the volume of movable oil from one or the other. Thus, careful core study and log analysis enabled better definition of the reservoir model which was then tested using cross-sections. 3 Cross-Section Analysis In study of this kind use of cross-sections to integrate geological and petrophysical data has number of advantages. Cross-section analysis allows the use of large number of layers, and thus can approximate the actual geological/petrophysical layering present in the reservoir. The technique can therefore obviate the necessity for the geologist to merge layers and estimate the resulting reservoir properties. Furthermore, where layer merging is necessary, various combinations can be tested quickly and efficiently on the cross section, and comparison made between the original and revised layering. The effectiveness and extent of permeability barriers and high permeability zones can be tested as well as the relationship between log and test derived permeabilities. Since fairly limited number of simulation blocks are being used, the technique is relatively cheap, and reservoir properties can be rapidly changed to allow sensitivities to be run. The power of cross-section studies is further discussed in the second example below. In the field study under discussion, cross- sections were used to assess the importance of tight zones between the sands and the impact of the two sand units defined by geology and log analysis. In the cross-section shown in figure 5, no match at all was possible if all the tight zones were assumed to be permeability barriers, thus supporting the assumptions made in the geological model. However, the tight zones obviously will reduce the vertical permeability, and during matching Kv/KH ratio of 0.1 was found to give the most satisfactory results. Perhaps the most interesting facet of the cross- section was what it revealed about the boundary between the upper and lower sand units. As discussedabove, the boundary marks change from the deposition of shaly sands to cemented clean sands, and is also an erosional surface. From analogy with similar environments elsewhere it was postulated that this surface may have been the site of soil development and possibly related cementation. On logs the surface coincided with thick tight zone (figure 4), and in order to match both pressures and water cut it was found necessary to make the surface a complete barrier to vertical permeability in all updip areas, where maximum erosion of the lower unit had taken place (figure 5). Thus, in this case, the cross section was used to test geological hypotheses such as the existence of permeability barriers and possible Kv/KH ratios, which were then used in full field simulation. 4. Full Field Modelling The use of full field modelling is natural extension of the cross-section work described above. However, layers are coarser, and due to the size of the model, changes are more difficult and more expensive to make. However, certain facets of the reservoir model such as areal variability can be tested. In the field under study the net/gross ratio shows marked changes areally. This is caused by the natural feature of fluviatile systems where zones located on, or near, the major axis of the drainage system tend to be sand rich, while those on the periphery are sand poor. Figure shows diagramatically this relationship. In sand-rich zones, where channels erode into one another, the overall transmissibility is good, as is the vertical permeability. However, in sand-poor zones both these parameters are drastically lowered. In order to account for this effect, the net/gross ratio was introduced as multiplier for the two horizontal gridblock permeabilities. It was found that for an effective match, the vertical grid block permeability had to be multiplied by power of the net/gross ratio because the interbedded shales parallel to reservoir layers will always have more pronounced impact on vertical fluid movement (figure 7). Research is continuing into more realistic ways of modelling such parameters as the effective vertical permeability, but it is hoped that the above discussion indicates that it is possible to improve reservoir modelling by iterative use of simulation models. CONDENSATE FIELD WITH NO PRODUCTION DATA. One of the major exploration plays in the North Sea currently is for condensate in Mesozoic sandstone reservoirs of the Central and Northern North Sea. Clearly, development of reservoirs of this type could involve markedly different development programmes from those currently in operation on the oilfields. Compositional changes, gas/liquid relative relationships and the possibility of cycling are important factors that require consideration and, as this paper demonstrates, the system becomes very complex making the prediction of the optimum configuration for maximum liquid recovery difficult. In order to analyse the problem, simple model was built using realistic reservoir properties. The model was then used to test various production strategies and the sensitivity of these to the reservoir geological model. Geological Model The geological model is illustrated in figure and represents an average Brent Sand package with three layers of high permeability representing the Etive Formation, low permeability layer at the Rannoch/Etive boundary and four layers of intermediate permeability representing the Rannoch and Broom Formations. Since this was preliminary study the model was kept as simple as realism allowed, and such features as very high permeability zones in the Etive Formation were not introduced.Reservoir Model A 16 cross-section simulation model was constructed incorporating the geological description as previously discussed. INTERCOMPS COMP 11 equation of state compositional model was used to simulate the performance of gas condensate reservoir under primary depletion and various cycling strategies. An equation of state PVT description for typical North Sea gas condensate was specified using pseudoized six component system. (The original fluid composition and the grouping of components for the pseudo system are shown in Table 1). The calculated dew point pressure for this system was 6568 psia with condensate content of 197 stb/mscf. Typical gas-liquid and water-oil relative permeability data were also specified with residual oil to gas (Sorg) saturation of and residual gas (Sgr) saturation of 0.15. The cross-section model was initialized under capillary equilibrium with gas-liquid contact specified at 10532 ft ss. The initial reservoir pressure at this depth was set at 6830 psia. Initialisation resulted in an average reservoir pressure of 6700 psia with total gas in place of 170.80 Bscf and total oil in place of MMstb based on flash of the entire hydrocarbon content to surface conditions. The initial values of oil in place for the Etive, Rannoch, and Broom sands are listed in Table 2. Two production wells were specified in the cross- section for all simulation cases. maximum gas production rate of 25000 Mscf with limiting bottom-hole flowing pressure of 1700 psia was specified for each well. (The total maximum rate for the two wells represents depletion rate of approximately 10% of initial gas in place per year). Case - Primary Depletion A 3-year primary depletion case was conducted with production wells located at 1=4 and 1=10 and each well completed in all layers. The results of this case showed rapid decline in oil production rate from approximately 8200 stb/d to 3100 stb/d in years. Results showed rapid build-up of oil saturation across the reservoir, reaching 25% in the lowermost Etive layer after years. An interesting aspect of this case was that the oil drop-out in the Etive layers accumulated in the lowermost Etive layer (Layer 3) with only gradual movement through the low permeability layer (Layer 4) into the Rannoch sands, as shown in figure 9. Thus the low permeability layer appears to represent at least partial barrier to gravity segregation of the condensed liquid. The oil recovery at the end of years was 17% of the initial oil in place. Dry Gas Cycling Case - Rannoch-Broom Injection/Etive Production A year dry gas cycling case was conducted with production wells located at 1=6 and I=11 with completion only in the Etive sands (Layers 1-3). An injection well was specified at 1=1 with completion only in the Rannoch and Broom sands (Layers 4-8.) The specified injection gas was 100% methane at rate slightly less than voidage replacement. The results of this case show considerable improvement in oil production rate and recovery over the primary depletion case. The oil production rate declined from 8200 stb/d to 5000 stb/d with recovery of 23% of the initial oil in place over the year period. The results as presented in figure 10, however, show that the dry injection gas moves rapidly upward into the high permeability sands, resulting in low sweep efficiency in the Rannoch and Broom sands. Thus, while representing partial barrier to liquid movement, the low permeability layer (Layer 4) does not appear to significantly restrict the upward movement of gas. Case - Etive kijection/Rannoch-Broom Production A dry gas cycling case was conducted with production wells located at 1=1 and 1=11 and completed in the Rannoch-Broom sands (Layers 4-8). An injection well was specified between the production wells at 1=6 and INTERCOMPcompleted only in the Etive sand (Layers 1-3). As expected, the results show an extremely high sweep efficiency of the Etive sands with dry gas breakthrough from the Etive sands to the Rannoch sands in the vicinity of the production wells (figure 11). Although the oil recovery after years (24%) was similar to Case 2(23%), some production acceleration benefits were observed due to the location of the injection well between the production wells, i.e. pattern-type displacement. This strategy resulted in delayed breakthrough of dry gas, and thus, the maintenance of higher productivities. Extension of this simulation case showed an oil recovery of 32% after 4.5 years. Case - Rannoch-Broom Injection/Rannoch-Broom Production The results of Cases and suggest that oil recovery from the Rannoch and Broom Sands represents limiting factor with respect to maximising recovery from the Rannoch and Broom sands prior to breakthrough of dry gas from the Etive sands. Thus, case was conducted with the same well locations as Case but completions only in the Rannoch and Broom sands. The results of this case showed a similar total oil recovery (33%) after years, but the recovery of oil from the Broom and Rannoch sands was much improved due to the increased sweep efficiency in these sands and the delayed breakthrough of dry gas from the Etive sands. Similar to Case 2, the dry injection gas moved predominantly upward into the Etive sands, sweeping these sands, and breaking through back into the lower sand in the region of the production wells, as shown in figure 12. Discussion and Comparison of Results Oil production rate versus cumulative production profiles for each of the four cases are shown in figure 13. Profiles of the mole percent methane in the produced gas are also presented for each case in this figure. The results presented in this figure show significant incentive for dry gas cycling over primary depletion. These results also show that, for the given reservoir description, production and injection in the lower quality Rannoch and Broom sands only (at least initially) represents the optimum recovery mechanism. The nature and quality of these sands will be the limiting factor in maximising oil recovery. Obviously, a recovery mechanism consisting of production and injection only in these lower sands requires that the productivity and injectivity of these sands be sufficient to maintain economic rates. The quality of these sands must also be sufficient to prevent substantial build-up of liquid saturation in the near wellbore region (i.e. large pressure gradients) which can severely impair well productivity. This recovery strategy would also be much less attractive if the Rannoch and Broom sands contained large permeability variations such as thin intervals with permeabilities approaching those in the Etive sands. An important result of the simulation cases is that the apparent optimum recovery mechanism is one which may not have been expected: i.e. produce and inject in the lower quality Rannoch and Broom sands only and leave, at least initially, the high quality Etive sands. This would also be feasible for the case of complete vertical flow barrier between the Etive and Rannoch sands. The wells could be recompleted when necessary to cycle in the Etive sands. Dual completions intially would allow monitoring of the Etive sands, while producing and injecting in the lower sands, to determine the level of communication across the low permeability interval. The results of these simulation cases indicate that the performance of gas condensate reservoir may be much more difficult to predict for given reservoir description than the performance of conventional black oil reservoir under water drive. Since the reservoir description will not be known with high level of accuracy when the decision is made to develop gas condensate reservoir, simulation will play an important role in determining the feasibility for range of possibilities. This study also emphasizes the critical role played by the reservoir geological model and, in order to make the model as realistic as possible, it is vital that maximum amount of data on permeabilities and permeability variation be collected by coring the initial appraising wells on gascondensate discovery. CONCLUSIONS The use of reservoir simulation studies, either cross- sections or full field, is an effective method of improving the reservoir geological model. The method is particularly useful in bridging the gap between geological and petrophysical data which are essentially derived from point source, and reservoir engineering data which reflects the response of rather larger volume of the reservoir. Use of the method enables the geologist to evaluate the extent of permeability barriers, assign reservoir parameters to simulation layer formed from several geological layers, and generally assign numerical values to reservoir features that are otherwise not quantifiable. Even in the essentially simple cross-sectional study of condensate reservoir it was seen that close interaction between disciplines enables better appreciation of the production mechanism and gives guidance as to which reservoir geological features will significantly affect the ultimate recovery. The geologist and log analyst may then be more effective in deciding which data are required to adequately describe the reservoir. It is noteworthy that in these reservoirs it is essential to maintain flexible attitude to the development philosophy. Development plans made at an early stage and rigidly adhered to may lead to the loss of otherwise recoverable reserves. Thus, those responsible for the development or approval of such plans should recognise the importance of allowing for significant changes to be made even during development drilling.
