Petroleum constitutes the entire organic content of Core 2. The oil is not indigenous, hence the formation in this depth interval must be considered a reservoir rather than eource rock. 4. The oil contained in Gore is geochemically identical to the oil produced from the depth interval 10363 to 10464'. The gas fraction of the oil from the 10363 to 10464 foot interval correlates chemically and isotopically with the gases obtained from Well 7/11-1X (9440 to 10197 feet) and 7/11-2X (9932 to 10190 feet) on the Cod Structure. 6. The oil from T.D. in Well 2/4-1X was generated in source rock comparable or identica?, to that encountered in Core from the 5461 to 5513'depth interval in Well 2/4-1AX.

Identification of the source rock for the oil contained in Core and produced from the 10363 to 10464 foot depth interval in Well -IAX was not possible from the samples provided. It is recommended that consideration be given to an effort to identify its source rock, and determine its volume, areal distribution and productivity in terms of oil generated and migrated, as an indicator of the pctroleum-producing potential et this part of the basin. The data upon which the above conclusions are based are contained in Attachments 2 and 3, Tables - VII, and Figures - 4. Basic concepts and interpretations used to arrive at conclusions stated above are discussed in the'remainder of this letter.'Mr. T. J. Jobin Er-239-69  Page Detailed mineralogical data for Lore in Well 2/4-1AX are given in Tables and II and the lithologic descriptions of the samples are given in Attachment 2. This core consists of soft gray clay shale with moderately varying fossiliferous and calcareous content. number of factors ditate marine environment of deposition., namely (1) fauna, (2) high concentration of the trace element boron as shown in the last column of Table I, (3) carbon isotopic ccmposition and abundance of calcium carbonate (calcite) shown in the upper half of Table II, and (4) the carbon isotopic composition of the organic fraction shown in Table III. Briefly, carbon isotope values less than are taken as indicating fresh water origin for the organic matter; to -29.0, brackish; and more than -29.0, marine. Except where there is major transport or organic matter, such as by turbidity currents, the environment as derived for the organic fraction is synonymous with the environment of deposition. As quantitative indicator of salinity, both the concentration of boron and of the clay mineral iilite must be taken into consideration. boron concentration  corresponding to three times the normalized per cent illite in the clay fraction is considered tlee lepundary between brackish and mal.ind environments. In Core 1, the boron concentrations correspond to eight to twenty times the normalized illite -concen- trations. These high values are believed to indicate that the...water bedyeinewhich the shales accumulated was hvpersaline. The occurrence of echinoid spines in random orientation wahSome perpendicular to the bedding plan in at least one sample indicates that de.Position_occurred rapidly. The dearth of coarse-grained elastics would seem to indicate that thesa shales were deposited in quiet water. However, the presence of broken shell fragments and of spines mm in length which were transported to the site of deposition after dismemberment, of the skeleton of the organism would indicate that the energy level in the environment was moderately high and that the fine-grain size of the inorganic detritus might. mean that no coarse-grained material was available.

Such an environment would be consistent with the clay mineralogy listed in Table and with the carbon isotopic composition which indicates-that practically no terrestial organic matter is present. This environment also would be consistent with the occurrence of dolomite facies at this horizon in the 2/4-1X Well only kilometer away, and with the uniformity suggested by seismic data from this horizon. A probable model that would satisfy all -1,ese data and interpretations is large salt structure well offshore the crest of which had been uplifted .to near sea . level by Middle Miocene. The shale previously deposited in this originally quiet .water environment would have been removed from the erest and redeposited on the flank. At the surf zone broken shells and echinoid spines would have been mixed into the shale. Carbonates deposited on the crest of the structure would have been dolomitized in the shallow hypersaline water and tongues of undolomitizied carbonate would interfinger with the shales.in .deeper water as is shown by the logs of carbonate content and fossil content in Figure 1. As shown by the good correlation between these logs the calcareous fossils are partially responsible for the peak carbonate concentrations despite the fact thee calcite crystals also are present. The crestal carbonates would have____ had _adequate porosity to have held the quantity of oil produced during the early stages of petroleum genesis in the shales on the flanks of tne salt structure. - -Mr. T. J. Jobin S. Mineralogic data for Core are given in Tables and II and the lithologic descriptions in Attachment 3. In general this core consists of fine grained granular marine limestone. The high concentration of quartz ard calcite and the absence of illite in the clay size fraction as shown in Table prevent an estimation of salinity based on boron concentration. Because the oil contained in the core is not indigenous the carbon isotopic values shown in Table IV apply not to the core but to the rock which was the source of the oil. The well preserved character of the fossils contained in the core indicate deposition in fairly quiet water; however, the relative abundance of silt-size quartz and the size of some of the spines up to mm in length suggest that the surface waters over-lying this site of deposition were affected by currents of moderate competence. The log of the carbonate concentration i-the core shown in Figure indicate that the non-carbonate constituents vary as would be expected if supplied by currents of small and varying competence. These rlata suggest aneenvironment of moderate depth and no great distance from shore. The presence of authigenic pyrite and glauconite in the core iadicates that the bottom meters were reduc:_ng and hence sufficiently deep to be relatively unaffected by the surfade turbulence which introduced the transported material. The well site thus was considerably seaward of wave base so that no tractive current depositicn occurred and sufficiently far from this turbulent zone that carbonate deposition far exceeded deposition from uniform suspensions in the surface waters. Absclute distance from shore or depth of water cannot be assigned without information on the seaward dip of the sedimena-water interface, whether or not there is sharp break in this slope, or whether the energ/ level in the water between the well site and the shoreline. Data pertinent to source rock evaluation of Gore in 2/4-1AX is contained in Table III., The procedure used foriecognition of source rocks has been discussed previously'). The organic content for all 18 samples from this core fall wi::ean the range to considered optimum for source rock. The ratio of soluble organic matter to total organic matter is very low, indicating that residual oil is indigenous to the rock. The high recovery from the silica gel absorbant indicates that normal petroleum genesis-is underway. The odd-even predominance or OEP values are higher than would be expected for mature source rock, i. e., rock in which maximum petroleum geresis has occurred and from which the petroleum has subsequently migrated. Those sections of the core with OFF values less than may have generated and yielded small amounts of gas and crude oil. From the relative concentrations of saturated hydrocarbona, aromatics and asphaltics contained in the extract any crude accumulated from the rock would be expected to be of relatively low gravity, highly aromatic and with reasonably high asphalt content. Data concerning the organic fraction of Core in Well 2/4-1AX is given in Table IV. Only few per cent of the organic matter deposite& in source rock and which survives geologic time is converted to petroleum. The remainder is converted to a dark brawn to black amorphous insoluble ubstance known as kerobitumen. The fact that the ratio of soluble organic matter to total oraanic matter for all twelVe samples frcm Gore are close to uniY indicates thai, the organic matter contarTed-iit EffiEe is present almost entlitqLas petroleum which could not have been generated in the rock affilo-t-ushave miarited in from pohx source. Core therefore must be considered reservoir rather than source rock. The odd-even predominance, i. e. 0a,P, values close of unity indicate mature oil probably derived from source rock in which (I) Letter Er-132-69 to D. W. Williams, dated August 12, 1969 Hr. T. J.

The uniformity in tho com:ositional and isotopic vales for the saturata:1 h:droca:-1:on, aromatic and asphaltic f:actions are consict:nt with the concept that the oil has migrated into the rock. The properties of the combined extract are fiiv.n in th) last colu-in of Tall- V.

The correlation coefficient for these two curves is with 19 degrees of freedom. Significance on Test is better than 99.9 per cent, i. e., there is less than one chance in thousInd that the correlation rIlserved between these two curves is by accident, therefore it is concluded that the oil in the rock and produced on -:,est is as would be expected, identical. The component composition of the lcJ molecular weight fraction of ti,e, gas fran the production test and the carbon isotopic values for the first several members of the hydrocarbon series are provided in Table VI. In Table VII are provided the ratios of the major constituent, methane, to the next four members of the hydrocarbon series and these values compared with the values for the gas samples from Well 7/11-1X, 2X and 3X on the Cod Structuro. The ratios for the gas from Well 2/4-la correlate with those for the gases from Wells 7/11-1X and 2X, but differ considerably from the ratios for the gas phase obtained from Well 7/11-3X. The isotopic data plotted in Figure provide additional support for this conclusion. Identification of the source rock for the deep production in Well 2/4-1AX was not possible from the samples provided. Identification of the source rock, determination of its productivity in terms of oil generated an migrated, its volume and areal distribution, would provide an indicaLer of the petroleum-producing potential of this part of the basin. Samples of likely source rocks from the present and/or future wells would be required. Pieces of core such as those provided from Cores and in the lAX well are ideal. Good sidcwall cores also can be used. JGE: 1L '19 1,1 Attachments 3, Tables 7, V* Figures Original Signed B7 J. GORDOA ERDMAN J.
