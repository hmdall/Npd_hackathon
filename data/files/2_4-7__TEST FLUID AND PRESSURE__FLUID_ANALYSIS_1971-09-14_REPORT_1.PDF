Phillips Petroleum Company - Norway P. 0. Box 72 Stavanger, Norway Attention: Mr. P. W. Reynolds Gentlemen: P.- '1\110(,,...i FiEn. ANftIPU NOCS ID:... Subject: Reservoir Fluid Study 2/4-7X Well DST orfelt Field North Sea, Norway Our File Number: RFL 7373 Two subsurface fluid samples were collected from the subject well during the shut-in period following flow period of DST 3. These samples were for- warded to our Dallas laboratory for use in reservoir fluid study. Pre- sented in the following report are the results of the study as requested by Phillips Petroleum Company - Norway. Prior to the reservoir fluid study, room-temperature iaturation pressure determinations were performed on both subsurface fluid sarnples. At 72 F. subsurface fluid Sample Nos. and were found to have bubble points of 2941 psig and 3007 psig, respettively. At thjA_point, subsurface fluid Sample No. was selected for use in the retervoir fluid .studyk_.:Stib- surface Sample No. was subjected to es sure-volume measurements at the repp.Ete_d_resexuzietcrriperature of 280 F., and the data from this test are presented on pages two through four of the report. Sample No. was determined to have bubble point pressure of 3910 psig at 280 F. At this point in the analysis, subsurface Sample No. wad set aside and subsurface Sample No. was used for the remainder of the testing. During a constant composition expansion at 280 F., the fluid was found to havePhillips Petroleum Company - Norway Page Two 2/4-7X Well, DST bubble point pressure of 3986 psig. During differential pressure depletion the fluid liberated total of 1662 standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of residual oil at 60 F. The resulting formation volume factor was barrels of saturated fluid per barrel of residual oil. The oil density, gas gravity and gas deviation factors were measured at each point during the differential pressure depletion, and these data are presented on page eight. The viscosity of the fluid at 280 F. varied from minimum of centipoise at the saturation pressure to maximum of centipoises at atmospheric pressure. A multi-stage separator test was performed and the data from this test are given on page nine. In addition, the primary separator gas from the multi- stage separator test was collected and analyzed for hydrocarbons. The re- sults of this analysis are presented on page ten. The hydrocarbon compo- sition of the reservoir fluid was measured by low temperature, fractional distillation. The results of this distillation, including the physical prop- erties of the heptanes plus fraction are given on page 11. Thank you for the opportunity to be of service to Phillips Petroleum Company - Norway.
