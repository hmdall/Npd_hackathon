Johnsen S Resyme Konidusion Anneraang Summary Conclusion Recommendation Mineralogical analysis of side wall cores and cuttings from the wells and Eocene sediments in the Hammerfest basin and on the Loppa high largely consist of biogenic silida. Earlier work on the Senja ridge has shown that biogenic silica trans- forms from opal-CT to quartz when overburden exceeds approximately 1400m. In the studied area this transformation zone is found at depths of less than 350m RSB. This is result of erosion of - km of Tertiary sediments. The results presented in this report confirm the conclusions from studies of Jurassic reservoir sandstones in the Hammerfest basin, namely that the Jurassic sandstones have lost approximately km of over- burden in the Tertiary.

Introduction Paleocene and Eocene sediments in well 7117/9-1 on the Senja Ridge mainly consist of biogenic silica (Moe, 1983a and 1983b). The results presented in this report show that Paleocene and Eocene sediments in the Hammerfest basin also mainly consist of biogenic silica. Biogenic silica (opal) is transformed to opal-CT and eventually to quartz as overburden increases. The transformation from opal-CT to quartz takes place at depth of 1430 RSB in well 7117/9-1 (Moe, 1983a and 1983b). The results presented here, and earlier work, show that the opal-CT to quartz transformation in the Hammerfest basin is found at depths of less than 350 in RSB. In several wells the transition zone is not present, and all opal-CT has been replaced by quartz. The shallow location or abscence of the transformation zone is result of previous deep burial and subsequent erosion of at least 1.2-1.5 km of Tertiary sediments from the Hammerfest basin. 2. Sample material and analytical techniques. Samples analyzed in this study were taken from the five Norsk Well locations are shown in Figure 2.1. No cores have been taken in Paleocene or Eocene layers. Sample material for this study has therefore consisted of side wall cores (56 samples) and cuttings (12 samples). Location of samples is shown in Figure 2.2. ow861222ojaS la ma on is as no _ 7 I* ii -tr3ot 12 10 0' 10 . 11 7f001 i Ikon Figure SEM and XRD analysis was performed on samples from the five marked wellsa an ia 600- 700' side wall core C cuttings Depths in mRKB 1.-9/0ZlL 80a soilt /19 p.

Analysis of the untreated sample was first performed and then followed by glycolation of the sample before it was rerun. The third run was carried out after heating the sample at 550C for two hours. Data from bulk XPD analysis were quantified by multivariate calibration technique (Karstang and Eastgate, 1986) utilizing calibration set of mixtures of 14 minerals. 17 samples were studied with SEM fitted with an energy, dispersive analyzer. Samples consisted of small (5 mm) fragments of side wall cores and cuttings coated with gold and palladium. Washed fragments of side wall cores and cuttings were studied with binocular microscope. A list of samples and performed analyses is given in Table 2.1. A comparative study of well logs from 23 wells in the Hammerfest basin/Loppa high area was also carried out. This work revealed that logs from Paleocene and Eocene layers are rather featureless and correlation is practically impossible. Depths given in relative sea bed are written as RSB.

The samples have high content of quartz, probably even higher than the values given in Table as our quantification procedure has tendency to overestimate clay content. Figure gives typical examples of diffractograms from the five wells. The diffractograms are completely dominated by reflections from quartz. This is also the case for the sixth diffractogram in Figure which is from below the opal-CT to quartz transition zone in well 7117/9-1 on the Senja Ridge. Mean composition of side wall cores from the wells is shown in Figure 3.2. Diffractograms for samples from 400 m, 425 and 445 in of special interest as they contain strong reflections from opal-CT. Diffractograms from 400 in 7120/12-3, 410 in 7120/6-1 and from the opal-CT zone in 7117/9-1 are compared in Figure 3.3. The opal-CT to quartz transition takes place between 450 and 470 it in 7120/12-3 and between 470 it and 500 in 7120/6-1. Figures to show typical examples of diffractograms from XRD-analysis of clay fraction constituents. The minerals present are quartz, illite, kaolinite and smectite or mixed layer smectite/illite. Untreated samples contain peaks from all the mentioned minerals. After glycolation the smectite/mixed layer clay expands and the corresponding peak moves to the left. Heating at 550C for two hours destroys kaolinite and expandable clay whereas illite peaks increase in intensity. The fine fraction has relatively high content of quartz.TABLE Results from bulk XRD analysis.

MIMS!Table gives the results of energy dispersive X-ray analysis performed on fragments from side wall cores and washed cuttings. Most fragments consist of silica or silica with minor amounts of clay. few samples mainly consist of clay. 5i02-rich samples may be overrepresented in Table due to the nature of the available sample material. After XRD-analysis, biostratigraphic analysis etc. the remaining material from side wall cores usually consisted of small fragments and finer material. Clay lamina desintegrate more easily and to finer particles than SiO2-rich lamina, and 5i02-rich material is probably over-represented in the sample fraction (fragments) suitable for SEM/FDX-analysis. Morphology of SiO2-rich samples is illustrated in Figures and 3.10. Most samples consist of roughly spherical aggregates of quartz crystals. Size of aggregates is usually 0,5-10 um. Opal-CT lepispheres are only found in the shallowest samples from Examination of washed fragments from side wall cores with binocular microscope revealed that SiO2-rich fragments are light grey to dirty white and have granular, sucrosic, texture. Clay-rich fragments are dark grey and have more even, featureless surface.Table 3.2.

Composition and burial history of sampled sediments. Bulk XRD-analysis, fine fraction XRD-analysis and SEM/EDX-analysis clearly show that the analyzed samples are very rich in quartz. High content of quartz and sample morphology as revealed by SEM, show that the samples are not normal shales. Composition and morphology is very similar to what is found in Paleocene sediments in well 7117/9-1. These sediments have been shown to mainly consist of quartz derived from biogenic silica Paleocene and eocene sediments in well 7117/9-1 consist of Si02-rich lamina and clay-rich lamina. EDX-analysis shows that small fragments (few mm) analyzed in this study usually consist of either relatively pure SiO2 or clay. This suggest that similar laminated sediment is present in the five examined wells. Each XRD-analysis represents an average of several SiO2-rich and clay-rich lamina. It is therefore not apparent from XRD-analysis that the sampled rock consists of lamina with different composition. The quartz-rich Paleocene layers in 7117/9-1 have low gamma-log readings. This is also the case in the wells examined in this study. Gamma-log readings increase at the Paleocene-Upper Cretaceous boundary and are significantly higher in the Cretaceous shales and siltstones (Figure 4.1). This is probably a result of the high content of quartz, and consequently low content of clay, in Paleocene layers. XRD-analysis and observation of lepispheres show that the uppermost Paleocene layers in 7120/12-3 and 7120/6-1 contain opal-CT. Diffractograms and sample morphologies are very similar to what has been found in the bottom part of the opal-CT zone in well 7117/9-1.a IIIIM I= IM INII MN Mil I= NM Mil IIIM IIIMI MI IS NM 7119/12-3 7120/7-2 712 /9-2 7121/7-1 7120/7-1 a- /0./2 V/ \2 / ,..../.(...- 03 \2 20 Paleocene Cretaceous I/50m Figure Gamma log response for the Upper Cretaceous and the Paleocene 130' 1.00$ 21 U.) aThe factors discussed above clearly show that Paleocene and Eocene layers in the Hammerfest basin largely consist of silica. Occurence of opal-CT and striking similarity of sediments in well 7117/9-1 show that the high content of silica in Paleocene and Eocene layers in the Hammerfest basin is result of deposition of siliceous microorganisms, as has already been proved for quartz transition takes place at 1430 IRSB. In the Hammerfest basin the transition zone is situated less than 350 from the sea bed, and in several wells the transition zone is absent (Figure 4.2). Only quartz is present in the latter case. The depth of the transition zone in 7117/9-1 agrees with temperature values for the opal-CT to quartz transition reported in the litterature (Murata et al, 1977, Pisciotto, 1981). This strongly suggests that the shallow depth, or abscence, of the transition zone in the Hammerfest basin is result of Tertiary uplift. Assuming that 1430m is the approximate overburden needed to transform opal-CT to quartz, the amount of Tertiary sediments removed by erosion in the Hammerfest basin can be calculated. Estimated thickness of removed Tertiary sediments is shown in Table 4.1. and in Figure 4.3. When calculating the thickness of eroded sediments Plio-Pleistocene and Quarternary sediments must be subtracted from the present overburden as uplift had taken place before deposition of these youngest sediments. Table 4.1. and Figure 4.3. illustrate that Tertiary sedimentSonce were up to several times thicker than at present (Figure 4.4.). The amount of erosion indicated by the location of the opal-CT to quartz transition is on the order of km to at least km.Table 4.1. Thickness of sediments removed by erosion.

This conclusion is based on sandstone porosities and degree of diagenesis which both are incompatible with present shallow burial depth. Extensive analysis of fluid inclusions in well 7120/9-1 indicates erosion of 1.5-2 km of sediments at this well location (Walderhaug, 1985, Walderhaug and BjOrlykke, in prep.)5. Conclusion. Paleocene and Eocene sediments in the Hammerfest basin largely consist of biogenic silica. Earlier work on well 7117/9-1 shows that biogenic silica transforms from opal-CT to quartz when overburden exceeds ca. 1400 (Moe, 1983a and 1983b) In the Hammerfest basin the opal-CT to quartz transition zone is located at depths of less than 350mRSB. This is result of erosion of at least 1.2-1.5 km of Tertiary sediments. The results presented in this report confirm that Jurassic reservoir sandstones in the Hammerfest basin have lost 1-2 km of overburden as stated in earlier work (Walderhaug, 1985, Moe, 1986, Walderhaug and BjOrlykke, in prep.) Present reservoir properties in Jurassic sandstones are therefore controlled by earlier maximal burial. Consequently, porosities are low in Jurassic sandstones with moderate overburden, and an economic basement will be reached at much shallower depth in the Hammerfest basin than on most of the Norwegian shelf.References: - Karstang, T. and Eastgate, R.J., 1986: Multivariate calibration of an x-ray diffractometer by partical least squares regression.
