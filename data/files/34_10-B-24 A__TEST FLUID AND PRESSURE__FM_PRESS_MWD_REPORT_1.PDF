This unique system enables the StethoScope* service to make the right test-first time measurement in wide variety of formation permeabilities and mud overbalances, known or unknown, within brief drilling-transparent period of min. Unlike fixed-mode pretests, in which the rate, volume, and duration of each drawdown and buildup sequence are fixed, the TOP intelligence adjusts the sequence to the conditions encountered. This capability allows stabilized formation pressure measurements to be acquired under conditions in which fixed-mode pretests have the potential to be inconclusive due to heterogeneous formations, depletion or unknown overbalance, all within minute period.

This is the first plot we will see and we will have to check and set the time for each circled sequence. Once we have the time sequences set we will look for Spherical and Radial flow profiles.To see the Spherical and Radial responses, pressure derivative time functions have been developed for each. If the pressure-derivative data is plotted as below, they have characteristic patterns when their flow regime is present.Drawdown Mobility During the drawdown, most of the fluid movement takes place in small volume immediately surrounding the probe. Thus, steady-state conditions are usually obtained very quickly. Using the spherical flow equation of slightly compressible fluid in homogeneous medium, the drawdown mobility, (k/)d, could be expressed as follows; (k/)d = ( Cpf / pss ) Where pss = steady-state drawdown pressure drop Cpf = drawdown proportionality factor q = pretest flow rate. The drawdown proportionality factor depends on the packer-probe configuration. Common values include:  5660 for conventional or long-nose probe and foe standard or reinforced packer.  2395 for large-diameter, 6151 Martineau probe.  1107 for large-area packer.  4857 for StethoScope675 and 825, 6266 for StethoScope475. The figure shows an example of mobility profile obtained using the sink probe. As this mobility is mainly that of drilling-damaged zone, it may not be representative of the virgin formation. However, experience indicates that it serves as good relative indicator of formation mobility Drawdown mobility profile obtained with single probeDrawdown Mobility from Pretest Equation Drawdown Mobility = (Drawdown proportionality factor) (Pretest Chamber Volumes) (dTi dPi) for all pressures < last buildup pressure Where: dTi = Ti  Ti-1 dPi = Pressure at the end of the buildup - Pi (dTi dPi) This is computed from the beginning of the first pretest to the retract cycle for all positive dPi, i.e., for all pressures less than the pressure at the end of the buildup. Drawdown Mobility Processing Cartoon Cartoon that shows how the Pretest reprocessing software is set up to calculate Drawdown Mobility of pretest. Hydrostatic before setting packer Draw Down Mobility is this area. Note; It is just called Draw Down mobility, but it integrates dP and dT over the shaded area. The Beginning of Pretest Draw Down Build Up Begin Of Build Up Pick This white area not used for calculating Mobility. after releasing If the Build up, or Build Down is steep then small shift in time will move the top line up or down good amount which will change the area that the Mobility is calculated in. Pretest Volume Positive increases in pressure before the Start of Build Up are not included and negative changes in pressure after the Start of Build Up are not included. Thus moving the Start of Build Up can affect Mobility.This is more what it looks like in real life. Once the different flow regimes have been identified in the derivative curve, localized mobilities can be estimated using the corresponding specialized plots. These involve plotting the pressure as function of the spherical and radial time functions. The slopes of the straight-line sections are used to compute the formation parameters such as the spherical mobility, the radial mobility-thickness product, and extrapolated pressure at infinite shut-in. The proper straight-line sections for these specialized plots are the data subsets that exhibit horizontal line in the derivative curves. The below specialized plots one for Spherical and one for Radial show the ideal patterns where Spherical and Radial flow regimes have been reached during pretest.Schlumberger Elap5ed time sec:' P~ssure (psia) Pressure [psis} 27.6 99 1010 P.

Al seo 1 Radial Special Plot I 4.1t ir 19;7.7 sec .....=...... i: Radial tirne tunciion 0,020Example of high permeability effects Anytime the pressure decreases rather than increases during buildup, the derivative curve will take sharp downward dip toward negative infinity (log of negative number -infinity). Typically, such buildup is considered un- interpretable. If this occurs for short period, then the final shut-in pressure may still be good estimate of formation pressure, depending on permeability. When the permeability is high, the total pressure changes seen during the buildup are small. The derivative calculation becomes more sensitive as the magnitude of the pressure changes gets near the resolution of the pressure gauge. The derivative curves may have the above wavy appearance. The true shape of the derivatives are often unclear. Good estimates of extrapolated formation pressure are still possible using simple straight line fit to the time function plots. Permeability estimates will be reasonable if the straight line fits reflect the true flow regime.If the permeability is high, then the total pressure change during the buildup is small. Effects such as wellbore storage are masked. Removing the usual early hump, as high permeability infers deeper investigation, Horner radial flow is more likely to be the only flow seen. Spherical flow may be masked as well. When the permeability becomes too high for the gauge to properly resolve the resulting small pressure changes. The derivative computation becomes so unstable that flow regime recognition becomes impossible. simple straight line fit on the time function plots will yield good extrapolated pressures. But the permeability estimate may be too high. Remember the pressure changes are nearly becoming less than the gauge resolution, making the slope of the buildup inaccurate.Recognizing Spherical and Horner Radial Pressure Derivative Plot Events Classic derivative curves indicating long easily recognizable sections of both Spherical and Radial flow. Only the Spherical derivative is showing Spherical flow. The permeability is likely fair, limiting the depth of investigation, or no horizontal boundaries have been encountered to alter the flow to Radial.Only the Radial derivative is showing section of that flow regime. The Spherical derivative may be showing short section of Spherical flow in the boxed area. The shape of the curve tends to suggest that no flat portion actually exists. Neither derivative is indicating recognizable flow regime. It appears that eit her the permeability is too low to allow sufficient development, or the buildup was stopped prematurely.Hydraulic Head Potential The vertical distance between the probe and gauges changes the pressure at the gauges compared to the pressure at the probe. As result the pressure gauges will always detect pressure lower than the actual pressure at the probe. The true measurement is actually at the probe so we correct the reading of the pressure gauges to reflect this. The effect is known as hydraulic head, which is simply pressure offset. The magnitude of the error introduced is dependent on the density of the fluid filling the flowline, the vertical distance between the gauge and the probe, gravity, and to lesser extent the compressibility and temperature of the fluid filling the flowline. Most of these are treated as constants. We need to know the density of the mud, and angle of the tool to correct for each pressure. Because of this effect the real time measurement will read lower than the final pressures which are hydraulic head corrected.
