ESSO NORGE AS MEMO Exploration and Production To: M. Peacock From: F. M. Haynes Date: June 4, 1998 Subject: Log Analysis of Balder 25/10-5, Balder Formation At your request have employed !earnings from the recent resistivity modeling of cored interval in the 25/11-B14H to re-address the thinly bedded Balder formation in the 25/10-5 well. Without core, the same constraining bed definition which permitted resistivity modeling can not be employed, but there does appear to be adequate log character to permit an evaluation. The result of the analysis supports those of previous workers. Specifically, the model yielded 17.7m of net oil sand with 30% total porosity; the previous work had defined 18.2m with an effective porosity of 26%. Neither my effort nor the earlier effort allowed SW to be accurately determined from resistivity logs, but assuming the penetrated sands are similar to those in the B14H well, it is certainly possible that SW is less than 20%. Acceptance of these lower SW would favor the high side interpretation. Table 1: Summary of Results for Balder Formation (1733-1820m) Bs = base case, hs = high side, Is = low side (Details of each case in attached tables) * Assumes lowest section (1802-1819m) is tuff and not sand. ** K.O.Foss analysis of uncertain timing (documented on attached log). *** High side SW based on arbitrary function of VSH, not direct calculation Log Analysis Procedures General A simple deterministic log analysis process was followed. Shale volume was determined as the average obtained from gamma ray and neutron/density separation methods. Total porosity was defined from the density tool, and total water saturation by resistivity-based Archie analysis. The analysis was performed with single interactive LOGIC job. Log quality over the interval is excellent. Calculated curves are stored as in run=91 and service = FMH-quicklook in the SOLAR dbase and plotted in Figure 1. 1 0_5fe2.DOCShale Volume To limit any adverse effects of non-clay sources of GR response or variable neutron and density matrix properties due to the presence of an oil column, shale volumes were calculated using both GR and nuclear tool response. Because neither method can be confirmed as best, the two results were averaged to obtain final shale volume. GRclean, GRshale, DPHISH, and NPHISH were defined from visual inspection of the sand and shale intervals. None were varied with depth or lithology. Porosity Total porosity was determined from the density log assuming RHOMA = g/cm3 and setting RHOFL to g/cm3 in the known oil leg and to g/cm3 in the water leg. This total porosity could not rigorously calibrated to core measurements, but appear reasonable when compared to field values. Effective porosity was calculated and stored, but not used in this analysis. Water Saturation Water saturation was calculated using the Archie relation employing the deep induction curve directly as RT and the total porosity determined from the density log. RW was assigned at ohmm, assuming 47 kppm chlorides and 160 degrees F. was set to 1.8 and was set to 2.0, both are standard values for moderate to high porosity sands. Reservoir Summation A volumetric assessment was undertaken for the Balder interval from 1733m to 1820m. To insure that thin beds get flagged, the shale volume cutoff in the base case was elevated from the customary to 0.5. However, to prevent too much shaly interval from passing the flag an RXO flag was also imposed in the oil leg (specifically rxo < ohmm was discarded as non-reservoir). porosity cutoff of 12% was employed to net reservoir sand, but no saturation flag was imposed in netting pay. Reservoir summation results are summarized in Table and detailed in Tables 2-4. These results are consistent with earlier reported log analysis summaries (Figure 2) and with the production tests conducted over the intervals. With attachments .cc D.

Prom: Fred J. Wagner, Reservoir Engineering Subject: 25/10-5 Eocene Test I pulled the wellbook and looked at the log-log and Horner plots for the two tests in the Eocene. There was no report, just the plots. Test 1100 bpd k = 600 md Strong indications of single boundary commingled with test perfs 3250 bpd - 300 scf/stb k = 800 md (might be higher if contribution of test interval reduced) the additional perfs are likely dominating as there are no clear indications of boundary present. Without setting up the analysis again, cannot really provide much more than the above summary. It will be interesting to look at the maps when they are prepared to see if the test boundary is evident. Let me know if we should do more. Fred CC: PMJENSE OSNORVM Jensen, P.M.
